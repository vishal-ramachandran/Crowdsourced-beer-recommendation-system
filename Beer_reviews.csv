Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,4.8,"2016 Silver Wax. Aroma has whiskey, maple, toffee and umami. Taste has wood barrel, umami, dark fruit, maple and toffee. Bitter cacao and coffee aftertaste."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,4.74,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a frothy tan head. The bottle gushed when I opened it. It smells and tastes of maple syrup, coffee, creams brûlée, vanilla, and warm bourbon. The feel is slick and smooth."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,4.68,"Probably the smoothest beer I have ever had. Smelled better than it tasted. Lots of notes on the nose from vanilla to caramel/Maple to figs, but the taste didn't follow suit and it mostly being Maple supported by the others notes on the nose and barrel. No discernible alcohol present but the bourbon flavor was there from start to finish. Carbonation was lacking and would have helped the beer. Overall this was an excellent beer on par with Mexican Cake Reserva."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,5,"Dark black, very thick, a little bit of tan head. Smells amazing - coffee and a little bit of maple jump out at you, along with chocolate and vanilla and other sweet smells. The taste is no letdown either, coffee is more up front, and maple is on the back end, with a lot of caramel / chocolate / dark fruit in the middle. Super thick mouthfeel with zero alcohol burn.', ""I was fully prepared to be disappointed by this beer - not that I expected it to be bad, but just that it might not blow me away. I was wrong. Probably the best beer I've ever had."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,4.97,"Poured black as ink with thin ruby edges at 58 degrees; fast fizzy cinnamon brown head; no cap retention, ring or lace; medium legs on swirl. Strong maple nose with molasses and roast coffee grind right behind. Sweet maple syrup and molasses up front; bitter roast coffee; dark fruit - cherries and plums with chocolate middle; no booze; maple and coffee on backend. Thick almost chewy feel; heavy full body; rich velvety tongue coating; no barrel or astringency; warming from 12%; creamy feel/linger on tongue. Overall awesome; strong long lasting maple nose; main flavors are in harmony; subtle dark fruit and chocolate notes add layers complimenting the whole; no hint of whiskey or barrel notes; and the feel is superb; world class!"

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,5,Amazing brew. The maple aroma pours out of this bottle upon cracking. The pour was pitch black with a nice brownish red head. Carbonation holds and the beer is thicc AF

Seems like it should be just a perfect beer, but I don't think TG does coffee as well as the other best breweries. I definitely got some green pepper."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,4.85,"Had this on tap at the 12-15-18 release in Decorah. The aroma on this was amazing and was a step above the flavor. This beer is a very good mix of coffee, barrel and maple but just shy of a perfect rating. Maybe because the expectations are so crazy high?"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,4.89,"Had this on tap At the KBBS release 12/15/18 pour was super dark, no head even when i attempted to swirl it. great aroma, lots of coffee and barrel. Taste was silky velvety smooth. Overall an amazing beer."

For a $1000 secondary market, should have been perfect, and just failed to miss the mark for me. The nose was incredible, but the taste almost had a metallic tinge to it."

The bourbon barrel also delivers a lightly sharp toasted coconut scent as it warms."", ""Intenesly rich and smoky maple flavors are met with a deeply earthy, dark roasted coffee that I don't recall getting as much of in the numerous Mornin' Delight pours and bottles I've had over the years. Raisinets and dark cocoa wafer intermingle with the aforementioned flavors, while a substantial charred oak and bourbon complexity amps KBBS up considerably. The black peppery woodiness adds a mild heat, and the divine maple aftertaste lingers forever, with a nicely warm exhale."", 'The super viscous and velvety thick body suppresses the bourbon heat well. A slow to surface fizz brings a faint sting with it during the sticky, semi-dry yet impossibly round swallow. As you get to the bottom of the glass, it thins out a bit and becomes a bit boozier and less complex, but such is life. Nothing is ever really perfect, is it?', '2014 vintage, gold wax"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,5,"This is the beer that I always thought Morning Delight should be - the maple syrup is prominent in the nose and taste, but not so forward and overwhelming that it becomes a bit cloying and unpleasant. The barrel is a bit subdued, but still comes through clearly.', ""KBBS is a once in a lifetime beer that I am sure I'll be chasing for a while now. As I shared this bottle with five friends, I only received about a two ounce pour - which I nursed for a bit and smelled more than tasted. It's so sweet that I think it is best enjoyed as well - let it warm up, let the oily texture because a little more fluid. It's a tremendous beer and best enjoyed very slowly."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,5,A buddy of mine called me one night and said that I needed to come over and try this new beer he found. Man am I glad I did because it was and is the best stout I have ever had!
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,4.55,"its always an occasion to drink what is deemed on this website to be the best beer in the world. regardless of what one may think about how such rankings are figured, it is a treat to say the least. i remember when i was heady and westy 12 before that, times have changed! after a couple of narrowly missed opportunities to drink this one over the years, my man drlovemd87 came through in the clutch with this rarest of the rare bottle. my pour is as thick as paste, slick and black like crude oil, and without hardly any head to it, near still in appearance, shiny, almost gelatinous looking. the aroma and flavor are intense but unfortunately (to me) familiar, i wanted this to be strikingly different, at least from a quality standpoint, and as good as it all is, its not head and shoulders above all else, it might not even be my favorite barrel aged coffee stout i have had this year (shhh). a few things are immediately obvious to me. the first is that whatever barrels these were, they seem to have housed some excellent whiskey. its not more or less of it, nothing about the oak profile specifically, but the bourbon character itself seems obviously better than most of what else is out there, this i will grant. the second thing, is that saying something like this is objectively better than something else in its category that is notable and near perfect and all of that, is highly problematic, approximations and cloudy memories and nothing more than opinion. factually, this isnt that much better than any number of great beers in its field, and i will stand by that. i cant spend the whole time drinking this thinking about the merits of a ratings system i dont control or other beers i like better though, that would be a foolishly wasted opportunity to enjoy quite literally the best. its full of rich bourbon, heavy vanilla and maple syrup qualities, even the texture of maple syrup, tons of barrel char and earthy burnt dark grain and chocolate, and a well integrated high end coffee profile as well, in some ways quite simple, but impossibly mature and nuanced, enhanced magically by the whiskey, and with lingering sweet, bitter, raisin, cocoa, and bourbon character. its as good as they say it is, that is not my comment. my comment is that others are at this level too. i am enormously thankful to have been able to drink this one, especially without having to pay the absurd secondary market prices this is fetching. if you are considering dropping some coin for this on a forum or whatever, i would reconsider, not that this isnt awesome, but its likely that your local bottle shop or brewery has something comparable..."

However, I expected a life-altering craft beer experience when I opened my hand numbered bottle of Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout (note: a bottle that was hand-handed to me by Mike at Toppling Goliath), and all I got in return was an amazingly good beer and a fantastic evening together with family.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/23222/78820/,4.31,"Huge maple aroma right out of the gate and a vicious, dark pour. Maple dominates the nose but chocolate, barrel, and some coffee see also present. The mouth feel is massive and coats the mouth for days with adequate carbonation. It all makes for an impressive experience, but the taste falls well short of world class. There is a sour note that I also found in Mornin Delight. Some reviews have described it as coffee bitterness, but that's not what I get. It tastes like an off flavor. Since I've tasted the same thing twice I'm quite sure this isn't just a bad bottle. I'm not a fan of MD and the barrel aged version doesn't cover over the flaws."

Not 5 times better than FO, certainly not 2-3 times as good as Henna marshmallow. Yes the vanilla balance was perfect but honestly it started to wobble a bit as it warmed up.

A very brawny BA stout.', 'T: Dark chocolate, vanilla, cola, light spice (cinnamon, clove) and light toasted oak, a bit of sherry and roastiness. Pretty long finish. The barrel is not very noticeable on the palate. As you might guess from the base, this is super sweet; the barrel and vanilla balances this out somewhat but not completely.

A comforting alcohol warmth gently warms your innards.', 'O: Big, sweet, rich, and pretty tasty beer. The cardboard note is distracting, and the sweetness is as overwhelming as it is in regular DL.

Vanilla fills the nostrils. Now I\'ve heard people talk that this beer tastes like marshmallow. I\'ve also had other beers people describe as marshmallow, but to me the flavor was not there. Here is a beer that is truly a liquid marshmallow flavor experience. Not only is that the flavor, but it coats the mouth and ""stays for days"".

As it turns out, I drank my BA Huna alongside of Double Barrel Huna, expecting that I would be blown away by the Double Barrel... in fact, it was the exact opposite experience."", ""And perhaps I should have expected that, given the barrels used in DB Huna - Rum and Apple Brandy barrels don't often tend to impart much thickness to a beer, and in combination, they definitely made the beer seem a bit thin. Additionally, where the bourbon barrels in BA Huna add depth, richness, sweetness, and complexity, it seems that Double Barrel just took on thinness and acidity. It's also quite charred in taste - it reminded me quite a bit of my gripes with 2018 Huna. Sadly, all of that cinnamon and vanilla that I love seemed to be entirely absent. It's still a sweet beer, but it's greatly overshadowed by the barrel notes and char and acidity."", ""In the end, I honestly think I've found myself preferring non-barrel-aged Huna as my go-to. It's certainly easier to get, and something about it is just a much more pleasant experience for me. Yes, I have a sweet tooth, so that's probably a big part of it.

Brandy and rum blend together nicely to add some complexity to the richness of the nibs. The chiles and cinnamon are very noticeable as well, but are balanced out by the chocolate and alcohol so it's never too overpowering.

Taste is quite complex, lots of chocolate and rum noticeable at first, with a decent bit of cinnamon and vanilla coming through as well. The chili really grows as you drink and the beer warms. Quite noticeable in the aftertaste in a really pleasant way. Quite a bit of warm boozyness there as well, but very smooth and mellow at the same time. Mouthfeel really is fantastic, very thick, sticky, almost oily and very smooth. I was considering waiting for CBS for my 100th review, but I think this one will do nicely.

As the beer warmed, yes got a bit of cacao and chocolate, but the barrel was extremely faint and I got no semblance of coffee. Very similar flavor to the smell.

Large, three-dimensional foam islands hang from the inside of the glass.\nLacing – Decent – mostly a continuation of the isolated foamy islands above.\nAroma – 3.75 – Herbs and resin, perhaps a weak grape or apricot.\nFlavor – 4.25 – Begins moderately bitter and resiny with distinctly no melon, fruit, or pine.

Looks wonderful, pours a nice, hazy orange-pale yellow color with some nice fluffy white head and glorious thick wide rings of lingering lacing that stayed throughout. Smells of very ripe fruit with food hoppiness - pineapple, guava, tangerine, mango, melon, grapefruit and passionfruit. Some nice aromas of malt, creamy vanilla, bread and then some more faint floral and dank notes in the background. Taste follows the nose, extremely well balanced and with good depth and complexity. Again a little dankness towards the finish especially as the beer warmed. Very well hidden higher ABV. Smooth, luscious, slightly sticky, fairly soft mouthfeel that coated the palate and was very juicy and easy to enjoy. Good amount of carbonation. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, just wish it could have had a little more power behind the bitter hops in order to tip the scales versus the solid malt backbone."

Decent retention and scattered lacing. Notes of orange creamsicle and subtle pine on the nose. The taste has a piney resin punch up front that fades into a silky orange vanilla cream finish. The feel is smooth and kind of lingers for awhile which is nice. Overall it’s a solid beer and was great to finally try it.

Taste was very hop forward with notes of citrus and pine, followed with a light malty sweetness, and ending in a boozey bite. The alcohol content definitely shines through. Overall a very good triple IPA, but I feel that the alcohol holds it back. What makes Pliny the Elder so good is the balance of flavors, which is lost in the Younger.

Now that we have gotten the hype proceedings out of the way, this is a decadent stout with layers of bakers chocolate, maple, molasses, praline, vanilla, pecan, smooth malt, and of course dark coffee. The smell features all of the taste flavors, but does so in the prism of the coffee, and adds some dark fruit too, amazing.

Heavy maple syrup and chocolate tastes it’s the best I’ve ever had! Want KBBS do bad! But heard this is the Real Deal, same powerful flavor and punch, but not as sweet! My only comparison is SR-71, it’s easily as powerful and delightful, just with a much less sweet flavor to it. Had Sr-71 on tap at the Decorah taproom. Amazing! World class for sure! Love this!!

Dank, resiny pine circles around the fruit, cutting through with a sharpness that’s noticeable, but not in any way distracting.', 'Big, bold flavors here. The earthy pine from the hops that was such a balancing act on the nose comes on full-force on the palate. The fruit re-emerges from that initial punch of hops, introducing notes of grapefruit, nectarine, papaya, and mango, all sitting on a familiar citrusy backbone of lemon and mandarin.', 'I think the mouthfeel on this beer is something really special that may get overshadowed by its other bolder characteristics. It’s medium-bodied, but verging on thick with a full, creamy feel to it. Incredibly smooth for 8.4%, with a resiny coating and light boozy warmth left behind in the finish. Although big and creamy, the carbonation is very much present, not too sharp but there to help cut through the abundant softness.', 'Overall, it’s hard to argue the nature of this beer. Incredibly hyped up, a factor nearly impossible to ignore, however it’s also impossible to ignore how damn good it is. Very well-balanced, and noticeably superior in every facet of grading. Beautiful color; bold, fruity nose; balance of flavor in hops and fruit on the palate; an amazingly smooth and soft mouthfeel that still gives a boozy warmth on the way down. A beer any IPA fan should feel lucky to try, and more importantly one that will appease both Juice junkies and OG hopheads alike. Cheers!"

The foam fades slowly leaving a sturdy edge layer throughout the sampling.\nBig aroma of citrus right off the pour. Orange notes and some grapefruit rind with a bit of sweeter tropical mango mixed in. not really any malt note that I detect and the booze is hidden as well.\nFirst sip reveals an amazingly creamy texture with soft gentle rolling carbonation. The physical traits on this brew make for easy drinking and are very enjoyable, maybe the best physical feel of a TH beer that I have had.\nFlavor is what is expected with citrus and citrus.

Having said that, this was an incredible imperial stout - a 2018 vintage that I had been saving for a while now and was waiting until a memorable time (review #700). Pours a deep, dark, rich opaque black color with some great-looking dark tan head - initially foamy and fluffy, later settling to a nice cap. The lacing was more spotty than I would have liked, but it still lingering for a long time and if it had been more sheet-like I would have given an even higher rating for this beer's look. Smells absolutely incredible - tough to imagine another imperial stout with better aromas than this one. Dark, rich chocolate fudge, dark roast coffee, an incredible vanilla aroma, caramel, malt, brown sugar and a touch of roasted nuttiness. Good hit of oak and bourbon at the beginning and end. Taste follows the nose almost perfectly - no reduction in the complexity, depth or balance of the flavor notes. The vanilla was better than any vanilla aromas or notes I'd ever previously experienced in an imperial stout. Crisp, bright and fragrant, I could drink stouts infused with that vanilla any day of the week. Smooth, rich, slightly thick and creamy mouthfeel and the perfect amount of carbonation. Decent amount of warming alcohol even when the beer was cold. Definitely a sipper. Pairs well with savory food - doesn't have to go with sweeter dessert like some other imperial stouts.

That being said, this is still an amazing beer to experience, so if you're willing to pony up for the price of admission (and can find it in the first place), I would absolutely recommend CBS to any and all BAs."

Lets get to it."", ""Pours out dark brown, nearly black. It seemed thinner than I anticipated during the pour. Only a tiny quarter finger of head formed during an extremely aggressive pour into a friends glass. Into my glass there was no such luck. But it didn't stick around for long anyhow. A little bit of lacing."", ""Nose was coffee, coffee, coffee. Right out of the gate. But it's a Breakfast Stout variant, so as expected. Then chocolate and wood. Not necessarily maple popping out but there in the form of mild sweetness."", 'Now what was excellent about this beer was the cascade effect as we drank it. The more we drank, the more it warmed up, it switched in prominent scents and flavors. Coffee had a turn, then chocolate, then malt, then maple, the bourbon, then back to malt, then back to coffee, then finishing with malt. All the while a small wood flavor persisted throughout. It was a revolving door of senses. Wonderfully balanced.', ""There was also more carbonation in this than I thought there would be as well. Provided a nice bite that tackled any sense of cloying or sticky sweetness. It cut through the mix and when swirled enough it brought some nice scent giving bubbles to the top. This was a perfect consistency. Not as thick as Rusty Nail or BCBS. But it absolutely works. It doesn't steal the spotlight, so to speak."", 'To say ""Another day, another fantastic Founders brew"" would be mildly reductive, but I\'m not sure I need to sing this beer\'s praises considering it\'s reputation. I\'ve been doing that a lot for Founders recently. If you find it, buy it. At least once in your life. And enjoy it with friends or perhaps by yourself on a snowy night. Cheers!"
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1199/47658/,4.53,This beer was $29 at Monterey Deli! The cashier gasped when they saw the price. I told them I'd tell them if it was worth it. Was it? I mean... it's a smooth drinking malty sweet coffee stout bomb... it's boozy and delicious... but probably not worth the price.

Sweet, a hint of coffee and chocolate. T. I agree with some that sweeter than KBS, which isn't a criticism. Rich, chocolate, coffee and sweetness. F. Syrupy, smooth mouth feel. O. Very good, although a touch sweet for a drinking beer. Might reserve for a dessert beer in the future and would be exceptional with macadamia caramel pie or similar."

It dries out only slightly and stays desserty. After the initial flavors fade away, you are left with some chocolate and caramel, dark roasted grains, charred ""campfire"" wood, and some dark brown sugar. Very flavorful!!!!!!!!!Q', 'FEEL: Very thick and syrupy. Maybe a bit thin, but being barrel aged and a high ABV, this may be a bit more common.', 'OVERALL: This is an amazing beer. I just recently learned of the CBS greatness and they just started showing up in Colorado. This one is very pricey but I just had to pick one up. It is basically a $1.00 per ounce (25.4 oz bottle). There are so many flavors that come through during the entire sipping experience that it is worth it. I may only pick up 1 a year now for special occasion, but am very happy with this one.

Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.9,"In Sonoma, CA, in a pint glass. Blah blah, all the stuff that's been said before. I looked this beer up on Beer Advocate before purchasing at a restaurant and was staggered by the reviews. I was pretty excited to try it, but expected to be disappointed."", 'Wow...one of the best beers I have ever had. I could describe the look, nose, flavors and mouthfeel to you, but others have described this beer more than adequately before me. And truthfully, nothing does this beer justice short of drinking one. If you have the opportunity, absolutely drink one (or I suspect 2+) of these. Really damn delicious."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.25,"Pours golden with chill haze. Floral nose. There's strawberry and grapefruit. It has remarkably clean flavors and none of the oniony character. The bitterness is clean. This is still a terrific and well-made IPA. Flavor wise, it is clean and well-engineered, but doesn't stand up as strong versus other legacy IPAs like Heady."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.93,"Having first had this years ago, it\'s nice to come back to and be reminded why it\'s still the ""gold standard"" IPA for me. Beautiful golden color, decent head and lacing. The smell is, I can\'t find the right words: pure? Golden? Wonderful?\nIt\'s the taste that sets it apart, though. Perfect blend of hops and maltiness. Citrusy and floral, and just the right amount of bitterness. My top-rated brew for a reason."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.74,"Here in the UK, Pliny is a true rarity. Finally managed to get my hands on one bottle, thanks to a friend making the pilgrimage to RR. Shared it with my Dad in our micro brewery, while brewing our cloned version.', 'An appealing visual golden liquid, but the scent and taste; shouting grapefruit, was what we both commented on. The real thing knocks the socks off our Tiny Pliny clone."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.43,"A good beer, with a lot of subtlety and smoothness (I've enjoyed it a number of times). That said, it's one of the more overrated beers I've had for the cost, and it's an example of how critical popularity can affect people's opinions of quality. For a much lower price, Racer 5 or Sculpin are just about as good and more widely available in California."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.81,"I was only ever able to snag one bottle of this from a friend that brought one back from Cali. I will have to say, this one has reset the bar for IPA's for me. For years I thought Bell's Two Hearted was the defacto standard for IPA's. Not any more! This stuff is amazing. Just the right maltiness to balance out the relative high ABV. And the hops....OMG, where do I start? I have brewed clones of this in the past that were pretty good. If the scale went this high, I would rate it a 10!"
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.15,"Being from Chicago, this beer was just a rumor. The times I have been to California, the story was always that RR shrank its distro area, didn't go here, didn't go there . . . so naturally I find two bottles for sale in the Colorado mountains having randomly stopped in a gas station/liq store for a Coke. I actually gasped when I saw it, like finding a soundboard Nirvana bootleg from the concert you attended."", 'It\'s a solid ale. Didn\'t look for the dating, but knowing ales it certainly tasted fresh. Ten years ago, I might have spread the Good News. But for the price, I\'ll look elsewhere next time. And I have several $20/4-packs that I return to despite bargaining with myself not to. Reminds me of Sculpin, in the above-average beer, way overpriced category. Not being contrarian; not saying ""I don\'t get it."" Just too much time has passed and too many brewers have caught up. Back in Chicago, cases of Zombie Dust are bypassed at Whole Foods and Binnys. (In a Budweiser world, kind of makes you appreciate Dom and Blue Label\'s perseverance. By the time I finally had Pappy, I was really impressed.) Pliny is a 70s film like The Conversation or Network, an album like Exile on Main Street or \'77 that is obviously a benchmark, but doesn\'t stir the soul the way it maybe once would have. I\'d go to the brewery and have it on draft for sure."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.86,"I was on a road trip last month and happened to befriend some cool peeps in San Fransisco. They told me about this brewery and how they make the \'best IPA in North America.\' Intrigued by their comments, I made a pit stop in Santa Rosa and went to a few breweries in the area before trying Russian River. I\'m not a fan of restaurant/breweries, but I must admit, it was a fun atmosphere. When I ordered this beer I thought to myself, ""this is the best IPA NA has to offer? LOL!"" Then I brought that golden glass of goodness to my nasal passages and was pleased with the scent. The only thing left to do was let my palate have a little action, perhaps too much by the end of my evening. I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth this IPA was. I do wish there was more of a carbonation texture, but this is nitpicking. Incredibly balanced IPA and I have been searching for it ever since finishing my road trip. I also heard they make a small batch called Pliny the Younger and apparently puts this to shame..."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.85,"This is still the pinnacle of IPA's. I still would stand in line to get it, and it still still what I rate everything else by it. Nothing to me has unseated it yet."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4,"Bottled 3/25/14; drank 5/4/14 @ the Yarchives.', 'Clear orange/yellow hue.', 'Off-white head; nice lace.', 'Orange citrus nose; notes of pineapple & pine.', 'Medium thin mouthfeel.', 'A refreshing mix of pineapple & pine; a touch too bitter at the end.', 'A nice summer day IPA."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.69,"Finally nabbed this unicorn at Monk's in Philly, on draft. Everything i expected to be.

Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.5,"Pours a clear crisp golden hue. Thin sudsy white head dissipates pretty quickly. Some light lacing is left behind.', 'Aroma is a lovely pungent array of bright fresh pine, orangey citrus, with some floral notes - orange blossom, honeysuckle, and a hint of bright fresh cut lemon grass. While the hops are quite aromatic, there is a balance to this as there is a definite light malt backbone coming through even on the nose.', 'Taste is follows the nose with notes of citrus - lemon, orange, tangerine and orange rind - along with fresh pine and a bright floral notes. Solid cracker-y malt backbone comes through. Incredibly balanced and restrained while still being flavorful and complex. Mild bitterness on the back end with some more piney notes coming through. The classic west coast profile comes through here but without trying to punch you in the palate.', 'Feel is light, crisp, and pretty smooth. Does have a slight slick oiliness to it. Moderate carbonation with gentle finish.', ""Overall, this is a lovely IPA with a well earned reputation. What was perhaps most surprising to me was its incredible balance and deftness. In a market saturated with IPAs that try to one up each other, this beer knows what it is and does it so well. Admittedly I've wanted to this one for some time and it did not disappoint - I hope this is not the last time I have this beer."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.6,"Imagine my surprise to see this on draft when walking into a bar in Philly. Apparently, the only bar to serve this on draft (in a very limited supply) is the one I was in. I had three glasses. This was one of the original craft beer unicorns ... and for good reason. It's great!"", ""I will say that beers have since started to catch up and I don't consider this to be an enlightening experience ... several good IPAs I've had are as good or better. Having said that, this IS an IPA to write home about and it's as perfect a double IPA as you'll find."", ""5-7 years ago I'd be doing cartwheels and rating this a 5 across the board. Today, it's a very good IPA ... one of the best. Still hard to find, even in CA! I think the hype surrounding this and it's February release with lines around the block, ticket lotteries and strict one beer per person limits brought this notoriety and high ratings."", ""It is very resin/pine forward with a crisp citrus base. If you had me test this and Lawson's Finest Sip of Sunshine, I'd have a tough time distinguishing. Maybe my preference would be for Pliny because it has a bit less bitterness and harshness as the Sip of Sunshine does. Pliny delivers on smoothness and taste without going over the top."", ""You must like IPA in order to drink this. To a non-IPA drinker, Pinesol would come to mind when tasting this. However for those of us who love IPA, though the hype may not live up to the actuality, this is as fine an IPA as you'll experience."", ""Though I had it on draft, I've seen it bottled and the packaging looks like genetic dollar store steak sauce. Completely cheesy and not at all indicative of the skill that went into the beer inside the bottle."
Pliny The Elder,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/,4.61,"A massive thanks and appreciation to Tim for giving me the chance to finally try this beer. This was a big-time want for me. Still, like all of my reviews, I strive to remain as objective as possible, resisting hype or other influences, and everything I write is done in real-time stream of consciousness format.', '500ml bottle - dated 060519 - poured into a large wine stem at 44F.', 'Pours a stunning clear deep honey golden, with a finger of fluffy bone white head, perforated with rings of air pockets, and leaving spots of lacing clinging to the glass.', ""Nose: I can smell this from several feet away. Gentle caramel malt, bursting with honey and flower nectar. The malt aroma is very tame, and really let's the hops have the spotlight. The spring-like floral notes emitting from the hops are unreal. Lilac, magnolia, gardenia, lavender, and honeysuckle, amidst a burst of nectarine, tangerine, mango skin, lemongrass, cedar, and new pine growth. The intense floral notes are the true star of the show here. It's like a flower garden in full spring bloom. Absolutely intoxicating."", ""Palate: The honey-like caramel malt gently greets the palate with a delicate nectar sweetness, before giving way to the bombardment of floral hops. Manuka honey, magnolia, lilac, and lavender surrounding ripe juicy tangerine, peach, ripe honeydew, and mango flesh. The overall flavour isn't tropical, but it definitely has a succulent, juicy, fresh-squeezed element to it. A rainbow of essential oils and floral terpenes just wash over the palate and transport you to an alpine meadow. The bitterness is decidedly delayed, showing up well into the finish. The finish brings notes of orange zest, fresh hops, and pine sap, before drying out, and shifting towards bitter pine resin and grapefruit pith. The longer it lingers, the more pine-centric it becomes, with a nice, firm, hoppy bitterness. Centennial absolutely shows, as does some Amarillo, but I am truly shocked that there's Simcoe in here. There are zero earthy, musty, or dank flavours. It's just so keenly balanced and rounded."", ""Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is on the lighter side of medium-bodied. The gentle malt sweetness and oily, resinous hops provide a nice smoothness to the feel, but the body remains quite light on its toes. I just had to double check the ABV, and that is quite surprising. This hides its ABV better than any other beer I think I've ever tried. In terms of heaviness, sweetness, drinkability, and alcohol flavour, this could pass for 6%, no questions asked. Effervescence is fine, and lively, giving the beer some nice lift, and furthering its crisp drinkability. This will go down very easily."", 'Overall: I\'ve said this once or twice, but I\'ll say it again. I hate giving a beer the same exact score in each category. It looks lazy, when really, I spend a lot of thought, time, and effort meticulously reviewing the beers I drink. With this one, however, it truly does earn a well thought out 4.5 in each category. That places it just within the ""world class"" boundaries, and I think that\'s precisely where it belongs. This beer may not be a groundbreaking revolution in brewing today, but one must not forget that this beer was a trailblazer. It pioneered the path of hoppy beer fandom, and it has truly stood the test of time. This isn\'t just a boring run-of-the-mill West Coast IPA. It shows subtlety and nuance that hops are capable of. It\'s malt bill is simply a work of art. It hides its weight with near invisibility. It shows that one does not need to rely on any crazy cutting edge double dry hopping methods. It shows that a little bit of bitterness is good, but the bitterness doesn\'t fight for the focus, or subtract from the drinkability of this beer. It\'s planted, precise, polished, and pristine. It\'s cohesive, collected, refined, and impressive. I used to think Maine Beer Company was the father of incredible, super floral-forward, clean West Coast (style) IPAs. I see the influence now. I see how this beer shaped modern beer culture. It isn\'t just an icon with a cult status. There\'s a reason it earned that status. It\'s a perfect double IPA. I set myself up to be disappointed by this beer. Many hyped beers do disappoint. This one does not. It\'s the grandfather of IPAs. It truly is a world class beer.', 'Edit: After some thought, I am upping the ""Overall score by one notch, simply because of how beautiful this beer is. It is truly greater than the sum of its parts. I feel a 4.6 is an appropriate score for such a refined, perfected double IPA. It\'s an integral part of IPA history, and it has secured its renowned status for good reason."

Mild vinous character, another punch of funk and light cracker malts.', 'T: Really follows the nose – lactic acid, tart apricots, and dry oak tannins.

Low alcohol flavors.', ""O: Good, maybe really good. But honestly I was a little disappointed. For all the hype, I expected something to blow me away and this fell just a little short of that.

Fou' Foune,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/388/5281/,4.1,"Pours a hazy, straw coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smell is dominated by sour funk, with some apricot and just a hint of citrus zest coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by barnyard funk and hints of apricot and citrus. There's a light estery yeast note and a certain earthy and slightly spicy note to this as well. Finishes very dry and acidic, with only a little sweetness coming through, and another mouth-puckering dose of tartness. Medium body and carbonation. I really didn't feel that this has a very rich, fruity apricot note to it at all, maybe it's the vintage (2017, I believe). The apricot is there, but quite subdued and overshadowed by the strong, funky sourness and citric acidity. This is a very nice lambic without a doubt, but highly overrated in my opinion, as it is neither especially subtle nor complex."

The ale has everything you'd expect in a fine hazy NE IPA. A dense golden yellow pour with a small head that dissipates after a few minutes. The olfactory senses are blasted with delightful fruit from the tropics (mango, pineapple, papaya), a bit of citrus and a pleasant candy hint. Those notes are evermore evident in the palate while the citrus of the hops comes through along with some notes of stone fruit like nectarine.

The taste was fruity and has similar flavors as the nose, I'm getting orange, mango and pineapple."
Julius,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28743/86237/,4.28,"Let me start out by saying that many Treehouse beers taste sort of the same to me. I probably couldn't identify Haze from Super Typhoon from Julius or Julllius or Juuulius or Juliuuuuus or whatever bizzare iteration of vowels Treehouse slaps on the can. Julius was the first Treehouse I tried because its their flagship. I've had it from the can and on draft at the brewery. It's usually the beer I get for friends who ask to try Treehouse."", ""Julius is a pretty perfect name for this as orange juice is the first flavor profile you get. This is a very thick mouthfeel type of beer and sometimes it's hard not to think of chewing before you swallow it's so thick. It's a beautiful orange color ... it almost looks like you took a picture of a normal IPA and ran it through a highly saturated filter turning it orange. There is a slight head but not foamy."", ""The sweet orange juice with a little dank pineapple is present along with just a hint of bitterness ... overall it's kind of like an orange juice shandy with an IPA chaser in one sip."", ""This is the one that started it all from one of the most famous juice forward IPA makers in the country. The smell when you open the can is similar to the sweet hoppy grape bubblegum smell you get when you walk into the actual Treehouse brewery. Are there much better IPAs which Treehouse makes? Of course. But this is the OG that started them all. I will say it doesn't hold a candle to King Julius but is a great beer with a weaker ABV, so if you are day drinking this is what you'll want to go for."
Julius,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28743/86237/,4.34,"Finally got to try this beer - the one I was looking forward to the most from my recent acquisition of a trio of Tree House offerings. And I have to say, I was a little disappointed - probably because my expectations were sky-high. I was expecting something even better than Green (which was outstanding) and unfortunately this one didn't deliver. It was still an excellent NE-style IPA, just not head and shoulders better than Green or even Haze. Canning date was 5/17/19, so still quite fresh. Looks great, nice slightly darker orange color with a fair amount of haze and very nice fluffy white head with lots of lingering lacing, not quite making it into sheets or rings but very close. Smells amazing, lots of deep sweet fruity hop aromas as well as some weaker piney and floral hops. Malt in the background, and a good hit of dankness towards the end. Tastes similarly - the fruit that I could detect included pineapple, passion fruit, mango, papaya, tangerine, lemon, grapefruit. So juicy and well-balanced, excellent tasting with good complexity and depth. Clearly enough to get a 4.25 rating from me, but didn't blow me away (to earn a 4.5) and didn't eclipse the Green or Haze flavors. Smooth, slightly sticky mouthfeel and just enough carbonation. Again, an excellent beer, certainly one of the better-tasting NE-style IPAs I've had, but just couldn't quite compare to the other Tree House beers I've tried."

While Lawson’s Sip of Sunshine is now more widely available and has a similar (if more muted) taste profile, this one spelunks the nasal passages and does a hop-laden tango on the tongue.

It carries a quality balance between hops and malts, while leaning lightly towards the sweet side. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a crisp texture that touches on effervescent.

It's too syrupy and one gives me a buzz and two gives me a headache usually. However, I am sucker for chocolate so I find myself drinking stouts on occasion.

Mine is the 2018 standard edition. I understand 2018 was a good year for this. It has a bitter chocolate taste with a little creaminess. The bourbon barrel comes through with a molasses taste followed by a bit of medicinal alchohol notes. It's smoother than some bourbon barrel aged stouts but lacks a bit of that licorice punch of KBS. I think those who prefer a sweeter creamier stout will like this.

Looks great, nice deep dark rich black color with a little tan lingering head and just a hint of some spotty lingering lacing. Would have given it more points if it had nicer-looking lacing, but I gave an extra 0.25 for the richness of the color and of the tan head. Smells great, lots of dark mocha fudge, vanilla, medium roast coffee, roasted nuttiness, caramel, brown sugar, raisin, fig, oak, bourbon and some toffee. Aromas blended well together and the smell was just heavenly. Taste follows the nose, and again that rich chewy fudge, vanilla, oak and bourbon is just so well-balanced. There was a little alcohol upfront as the beer warmed, but not aggressively so, and the very high ABV always felt deceivingly well-hidden. Smooth, rich, chewy, thick, slightly syrupy mouthfeel that coated the palate. Just enough carbonation to match the depth of this stout. I really enjoyed it, wish I had more bottles to sample and savor at a later date, and couldn't recommend this beer more highly. It paired well with both savory dinner and sweet dessert. Delicious!"

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/313/1545/,5,"Consistent. Unique. Incomparable. You can shamelessly wax lyrical about Westvleteren. So, I will. My sin of cheesy cliche won't be absolved. To try any Westvleteren is a rite of passage. I have been visiting Westvleteren Abbey since the late eighties. Back then, you turned up on spec, no appointment or reservation needed, and loaded up. 10 crates was the max. If you are lucky, you can get two crates now. Or a take out pack of six, or two, from the cafe opposite the monastery gates. This is what hype has done. But also, has not. This beer is the same now as I remember it >30 years ago. No succumbing to fad or fashion. Now, a further, but very important point. Listen to the monks! Westvleteren is made to age. It really does get more surreal with months, even years on it, if stored cool. Yesterday I cracked open a bottle from my stash brewed in January 2019. For me, it has cream and ginger characteristics, and they were really getting a hold here and singing. For you - well, you decide. Even the taste evolution from the February release was interesting. Its texture, too, is like no other. You don't just taste it - you hear it. So. Drinking Westveleteren 12 (and 8 and 6 for that matter) is a ceremony. A truly personal experience, whether you are religious, agnostic or an atheist. Meanwhile, the myth shrugs its shoulders and keeps on delivering one world class, perhaps once in a lifetime, experience. Visit the Abbey. And have your ceremony."", 'Finally. Just a note on its price. Bear with me here. If you are lucky enough to get to reserve a crate or two to collect, or buy it at the Cafe opposite the monastery, remember this. This beer is not supposed to be for resale. It is, however, MASSIVELY good value. A world class bargain. The rip off merchants that make this available through resell are doing so against the spirit of what Westvleteren beer is all about. So, feel the guilt if you bought this off site - but do not criticise the price you paid for it."

Luscious and full, I was struck by the balance between alcohol and sweet flavors. Simultaneously a liquid lunch and clean on the palate. The alcohol cleanses the palate after the cacophony of flavors of ripe fruits, caramel, and molasses. I was amazed that a beer this rich left me itching for more, as I would expect the richness to be over-satiating. Just the opposite."

Outside of having twisted mannerisms and catchphrases suspiciously resembling the two SNK characters that were ripping off Capcom characters that he was ripping off, Dan is kind of memorable for being all show and no power whatsoever; his super/EX combo finish, Shinkū Gadōken, for example, looks awfully similar to Ryū’s Shinkū Hadōken while doing 1/40th of the damage it does—many-a-times have I sat in front of the TV screen, thinking “oh shit I’m fucked” when I saw the screen suddenly turn red, orange, and yellow while CPU Dan caught me off guard with my HP at 30%, only to realize my character was still alive after being hit by ostentatious super combo.', 'Labored metaphors aside, BAIGCC is similar to Dan’s super finish in that it packs all the flavors it purports to deliver in one ginormous, sugar-spice-and-everything-nice upside your head, but then presenting a rapidly drying finish, which makes you feel stupid for cringing and bracing for impact—it’s hard to explain in close detail, but it’s like the opposite of getting a penicillin shot at the doctor’s, where you don’t feel the needle going in, but it feels like somebody injected the meaty part of your butt cheek with peanut butter for the rest of the day.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nA vacuum wave motion fist of toasted coconuts, wild sugar cane, rum cake, baker’s chocolate, intense caramelized sugar hits you square in the noggin, followed by a frosting-like sweetness. There’s a slight hint of hazelnuts that follow the gargantuan sweet super attack before all the flavors just simply drop off the side of the earth. Save for some residual flavors of hazelnuts and powdered sugar, your pixelated character brushes off the blow as if nothing happened and gets up ready to fight again—the fight against the glass is one of attrition after that initial “surprise”\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThe mouthfeel is initially thick and sticky like raw cake batter, but it morphs into a more tolerable moist-ish soft texture with subsequent sips. The only way carbonation could make any impact on this beer is if it were effervescent to the level of a brut champagne; the intense brick wall of mouthfeel counteracts against any fleeting semblance of carbon dioxide on the tongue."
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32409/271487/,4.99,"Dark black with a pretty thin tan head. Smell is pure vanilla and coconut. Taste is out of this world, one of the best things I've ever tasted, period. Coconut up front, smoothing out into pure chocolate flavor that really does taste like German chocolate cake. The only knock I'll give it is that the barrel doesn't come through a ton in the flavor, but it's hard to call that a negative when it tastes this good. Pretty sweet, but not painfully so. Smooth feel, maybe I'd like it a little bit thicker, but again - this is just quibbling and it's hard to really knock this at all. Fantastic."

The mouthfeel is also world class, light and chewy at the same time. Just about as good as it gets.\nSo, this was so good I decided to pull a 2016 out of my cellar and try it against the fresh.

I knew that Duck Duck Gooze was on the top 250 on Beer Advocate - but I never expected that I'd be able to try it."", 'Well now. I recently made a Facebook friend who used to live in San Diego but now lives and brews in northern Minnesota. Happy coincidence!

I was thrilled, and still am - the beer is fantastic!', ""It's interesting to me how DDG differs from Belgian gueuze though - the characteristic funk seems to be entirely absent, and the nose doesn't pop to quite the same degree. It smells very nice, but it's a different sort of aroma - and taste. There's a bit of cheese to the taste, and a very light, clean, crisp sort of sour and tart character. Again, the Belgian funk is missing. Perhaps this has been lost with time, but it surprises me as older Belgian lambic still seems to retain that funk. There's also a marked lack of suspension - there's no noteworthy presence of fruit, yeast, or foreign matter of any kind. I don't mind that! I know some really enjoy that in Belgian lambic, but it's a happy absence as far as I'm concerned."", ""I'd have to say that DDG characterizes all of the things that I love about gueuze, while it also happens to have bypassed the aspects that I am not such a big fan of. It's a terrific beer, and really demonstrates why Lost Abbey is such a hyped and touted brewery. I think that I will always try far harder to pick up bottles of Russian River sours, because they're just a lot more accesible - but I will never pass on the chance to try another bottle of Lost Abbey.

Zombie Dust,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/26/64228/,4.04,"Waited to try this beer for years and then kind of forgot about it. Suddenly it appears on local shelves. It is pretty good for only having the terrible Citra hop being used (I am sorry but Psuedo Sue is terrible). I would describe this as the original juicy pale ale before the haze craze came along. It also has the benefit of having bitterness and not being overly sweet. Would I drink this regularly? Probably not as I am more in the pine, herbal, earthy, dank spectrum with hoppy beers."

There is a fine line of too little and too much but this has the sweet spot of exactly the right quantity of hops to make this beer so thoroughly enjoyable."

Pours a much deeper color than I expected, a burnt orange with a smallish head and just a little lace. Nose is certainly muted for such a highly rated beer. Some orange and earthy/herbal notes along with caramel malts, but much more subdued than I hoped for. Hard to believe this is an all citra beer.\nFlavor is bigger. Drinks like an 8% beer and is well balanced, although the flavors don't really pop. Orange rind and caramel malts again...a little grapefruit, but this isn't a super citrusy beer. Resiny too, which helps balance the malt. Overall, a good beer, but it did not live up to the score here."

Zombie Dust,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/26/64228/,4.1,"I used to get this for $35/case at the brewery, then I got tired of it and craft beer passed FFF by. Too many comparably good options for much less money. Now that ZD actually stays on the shelf, it's become difficult to find fresh bottles. (Bottle dated 6/12 being drank on 7/1) Does the nostalgia hold up? The balance of the beer is what's key. Too many FFF beers have the same flavor, but the bitterness, malt, carbonation are just right with this. It's still too expensive, and I don't consider overpaying for beer to be 'treating' myself. But if some are content to pay more than $100 to see an 80-year-old Stones cover band, I guess I won't be judged too harshly for this pit stop. But I'm done. Felt like a douche sleeping with an old flame when I bought it, and I still feel dirty having drank this."

Very nice aromas - lots of juicy grapefruit, mango, pineapple, tangerine, lemon and passion fruit fruity hops along with some floral and piney hops, nuttiness, caramel, vanilla and malt. Taste follows the nose, and there’s a great balance between the hoppy bitterness and smooth sweeter malt backbone. Good hit of bitter hoppiness at the finish.

A weak looking head for a BCBS variant.', 'What it lacks in looks it makes up for in the nose as this was a wonderful combination of fresh vanilla beans, vanilla extract, toffee, bourbon, caramel, mild char, cocoa powder, vanilla icing like you get off cupcakes and some sweet roasted malts. The vanilla is so incredibly fresh that it seems like someone poured vanilla extract into a stout. Exactly what I hoped it would smell like, I’m loving every second of this.', 'The flavor is equally as good as the aroma. The vanilla sweetness takes out the bitterness from the regular version, but it’s not to sweet to turn it into a dessert beer. The bourbon, toffee, char, light oaky notes, burnt coffee grinds and cocoa balance out the vanilla extract taste and it seems like a BCBS was aged on fresh vanilla beans and espresso beans. A year later and this brew still has some alcohol burn, but it’s so complex and enjoyable that I’m savoring each thick, delicious sip which gets better as it warms. World class smell and taste for sure, worth every penny of this expensive bottle."

Flavor follows, with dark toasted malt, fresh tasting vanilla, a hint of cocoa and bourbon with some light oakiness in the finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. Well, it's time to drink and review my last two BCBS variants from 2018, because the new batch is around the corner. I was a little nervous about this one because, while I like a touch of vanilla in stouts, I'm not a fan of over use of vanilla flavor. The vanilla here is a dominant component and tastes like fresh vanilla smells, but it blends nicely with the base BCBS. Mission accomplished, a fine vanilla imperial stout and a worthy variant of this classic stout. That being said, I'm not sure this is a big improvement on the stock Bourbon County and has a little less Bourbon character, which is one of my favorite parts of the regular stout.

Fortunately, the dominate vanilla nose doesn't carry over to the taste. It is definitely there, but if it were as strong as the aroma it would be overwhelming. It's very smooth for the ABV, mostly hidden by the sweetness. Feel is on point and just like the appearance, consistent with others iterations of Bourbon County. Overall, this was very enjoyable.

Also some more balanced malt, vanilla, bread, and then some floral and grassy hop notes at the end. Dankness was muted and well-restrained.

The mouthfeel of these world-class NE IPAs is just ridiculous - soft, juicy, slightly sticky, coats the palate, smooth and creamy. Perfect amount of carbonation.

Doubleganger,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28743/259249/,4.35,"Traded for this a while ago, as the can was dated 6/15 of last year with ""BEST OFFICE COLD OPENER"" written above it. Heard a lot about this beer and it was not easy to obtain but for some reason, this didn\'t stand head and shoulders above the better offerings that I\'ve had from Tree House over the years. Full, dank, and full of underlying strength, this was a solid offering that improved greatly as it warmed up, but never did I feel that this was a ""wow"" beer...', ""Nice pour to this as the liquid was a muted goldenrod and quite cloudy, as was expected. Lots of tropical fruit rind in the nose with a good amount of mango, papaya, and kiwi in the muted aroma. The taste had all of those in it along with tangerine, orange juiciness, white chocolate sweetness, dank pine, and a subtly everlasting hop presence. Full of dough and malt, this had a good body to it for one of their beers as this was certainly not your typical hop bomb or overly typecast New England IPA. The moderate head and spotty lacing were signs that this wasn't as impressive as I had hoped but still had enough depth to be a solid beer."", 'Enough booze was here although I never tasted or felt it at any point while enjoying this. A solid beer for the winter, there were plenty of fruit flavors and potency here to keep me interested and warm throughout, but this was short of being spectacular. Fans of Tree House will certainly not be disappointed with this, however!"

Doubleganger,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28743/259249/,4.54,"Pouring a cold 16 oz can into my snifter. The beer pours a cloudy goldenrod color with 1.5 cm of dense bleached white head foaming up from an aggressive pour. I get a mix of citrus and pineapple notes on the nose. I also get a bit of a creamsicle note on the nose. The alcohol is well hidden and I dont get a lot of malt character here.\nFirst sip reveals a soft silky textured body with gentle rolling carbonation. The beer is amazingly easy to drink especially considering the bigger ABV on this one.\nFlavor is what is expected from the nose on this brew. I get some orange zest, a bit of grapefruit rind and some tangy pineapple. The fruits dominate the flavor profile here and only a hint of bitter hop comes through on the finish. I would say this is rindy or pithy note and it lingers with a slightly drying finish. Still no real hint of the booze and this beer is very drinkable just like its sibling doppelganger.

Thanks!\nThe beer pours a hazy gold to orange color with a fleeting bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up and fading to a frothy surface layer quickly after the pour. The aroma is strong and hop centric with grapefruit and lemon with a bit of resinous pine sap mixed together. I also get just a bit of biscuity malt buried in this hoppy brew. I dont get any booze notes on this one.\nThe first sip reveals a fairly light crisp body with very fine and tingly carbonation. The texture is smooth and the beer glides across my palate effortlessly on each swallow.\nThe flavor is as the nose advertised at the start of this sampling. There is a bit of sweet biscuit malt and then a lot of citrus hop character with lemon and some orange mixing, which rolls to some more bitter rindy grapefruit. The beer dries out on the finish and does leave some rindy and resiny hops on the finish. Again I dont detect any booze and the beer drinks very easy. Quite a nice double IPA"

Bitterness is present, but doesn't taste like it is anywhere approaching 100+ IBUs. Beyond this point, the taste doesn't change all that much and these aspects tend to carry through to the end which is just fine.

Opacity is hazy, partially due to the chill, and partially due to a poor pour on my part – I likely stirred up the layer of spent-yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle during my far-too-vigorous pour. Carbonation is light in density, but heavy in quantity. 1-inch head dissipates very quickly, giving way to very lively bubbles in the center of the glass that persist throughout the tasting. First smell yields obvious fermented fruits; among them cherry, raspberry, and perhaps a bit of wild plum. Upon taking my first sip, I let the liquid wash over the entirety of my tongue to feel the light pricks of carbonation. The drying sourness is quite powerful. The flavor is similar to the nose, beginning with tart cherries leading to a warming sensation that blends well with a touch oak at the back of the tongue. As the flavor develops, I detect a slight malty sweetness that I didn’t notice on the nose. The oak and malt slowly mature into an earthy effervescence in the back of the mouth.

Pours a very nice, slightly hazy yellow color with abundant fluffy white head and sheets of lingering lacing. Looks very, very nice.

Taste follows the nose, but there was a decent hit of hoppy bitterness towards the middle and finish that wasn't unpleasant, just a little more sharp than I was accustomed to. I also expected more juiciness and I just didn't get it - maybe that left more harshness of the hops. Good, solid, mellow, mild mouthfeel and good carbonation. Not really sticky.

An intricate mixture of dragonfruit, citron, floral hops, and light resin forms the aromatic basis of the brew.

Green,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28743/88969/,4.69,"Just. Amazing. All the hype is true. I tried so hard not to let my preconceived notions of this beer sway me - I'd heard all the hype, read some reviews (although I tried to stay away from many of them), know all about the mystique surrounding Tree House Brewing Company. Managed to find a trio of Tree House IPAs online and couldn't save them for a special occasion as I wanted to sample them as fresh as possible. This one was the oldest - canned on 3/27/19 - so it was first up to bat. And oh man was this an amazing NE-style IPA. Clearly the best I've ever had. Looked absolutely outstanding - hazy pale yellow color, layers and layers of pillowy-soft fluffy white head and abundant sheets of lingering lacing that lasted forever. I gave it a 4.75 rating for look, just out of principle of not giving 5s, but I'm not sure how much better a beer could have looked. Smells incredible, loads of fresh citrus juicy fruit - pineapple, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, a little lemon - with some more faint floral hops and malt in the distant background. Taste follows the nose, and that sweeter malt backbone was very restrained and tame. That was good since there wasn't as much of a bitter hoppy hit as I was expecting at the finish. The mouthfeel was out of this world - soft, inviting, pillowy, luscious, slightly sticky. Smooth, creamy and juicy and perfect carbonation balance. Honestly I can't believe this beer had a higher ABV as it was like drinking some sort of luscious juicy summer concoction. Well done, Tree House. Well done."

Both simple and then complex to light.\nNose was rich with toffee/caramel; wood; vanilla; soft herbal flower and bitterness. Taste magnified all these and slowly revealed tannins; slight hints of licorice; apple; and allspice as it warmed. Sweetness but never candy or cloying. Traces of whiskey helped round out flavors but well in background.\nFeel was luxuriantly soft and smooth; very mildly dense like young port but never thick or distracting.\nOh and $4 for 4oz glass????\nAbsurdly good beer and very accessible cost.\nBarreled EBW is one of my favorite styles ... and Aaron is without question the best I’ve ever had.\nMasterpiece.

This was one of my biggest wants because I figured Hill Farmstead does everything else great, I bet they would nail a Barleywine as well. Oh, and it is barrel aged for like an eon. Aaron pours a dark brown. Not necessarily clear bodied behind the tint of the beer. A thin, defeated ring of diminutive bubbles rest steadily around the outer conversion of beer and glass; the only thing minute about this beer. The aroma rises out of the glass like a slothful perfume. Thick, damp whiffs of bourbon, raisins, toffee, and dessert wine. Detailed, rich, royal. The flavor marches in line with the nose. Heavy, sweet, and decadent. I think the older batch has a bit more complexity but lacks the barrel character of it's newer kin. I get some flavors of boozy dates and maple syrup from both, though. Of course the feel stands abreast with the other elements of the beer. Portly, heavy, and warming. Toothsome but intense. Definitely lived up to the hype I personally gave this beer. The best Barleywine I have ever had."

Belly warming caramel frosting is lifted by Jack and Coke--it sounds odd and maybe off-putting, but it's light on the palate, helping its drinkability. Heavier notes of dark fruit and vanilla marshmallow fluff are again countered by sweet, light and even floral fig, which all begins to transform into fresh coconut on the exhale, especially as it warms."", ""Tingly and even crisp, the medium body is really easy to drink for a big burly barleywine.

I have been dying to try this for quite some time. While it is an enjoyable offering, I can't say I would wait in a line to get my hands on some. There's a lot of competition out there, and with Tree House and Trillium in the mix, making a world class IPA that people will go out and hunt is a very difficult task. Several years ago, I can see people being blown away by this, but in my opinion, it's an above average New England IPA. Would I drink it again? Yeah, definitely. Would I pay for it? Yeah, I think so. I just wouldn't go out of my way and bend over backwards to try to get it, when I can trade for some Tree House or Trillium. Nevertheless, it's a solid ale, and it's a hell of a lot better than some other local hoppy offerings I've had. I'm gonna go with a solid 4.3 on this one."

Throughout the drink, the bitterness increases, as does the alcohol spice, to its credit, without booziness.\nMedium to full bodied, gently carbonated and with a smooth mouthfeel, due perhaps to the addition of wheat and oats.

Lots of bourbon and ethanol. Also lots of dark fruits. I only get hints of chocolate, vanilla, and char.\nT - The flavors are typical bourbon notes; vanilla, oak, char, and hints of caramel. There are sweet chocolate undertones throughout. But there is a big ethanol bitter finish.\nF - Thin body, but a little sticky\nO - I'm a little disappointed.

Taste - pretty powerful blast of sourness and tart fruit - slight yeast and bread - some malt - mostly sour but backs off and other flavors come through then. Feel - medium bodied (which is a bit fuller than a typical barrel aged sour) and stays at a higher level of carbonation than expected.

There is also a distinct smell of oak. It\'s very fragrant. As expected, the taste opens strongly sour with bitter lemon notes. There is also a subtle taste of grape that gives it a small amount of balancing sweetness. As the glass warms you can increasingly taste the oak barrel and it finishes fairly bitter.

Beer:Barrel:Time,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32319/275206/,4.69,"Amazing barrel forward stout. Smells like vanilla wafers and charred oak and dark caramel. Baffling complexity combined with sufficient sweetness. And while the booze is currently still fairly intense, I can see this aging beautifully. Mouthfeel was full but as usual is the case in any non-TG beer, I wouldn't have minded a bit more substance there. Altogether of the best barrel aged beers I've ever tasted and perhaps (surprisingly) i enjoyed it even more than any of the Derivations I've had."

Tastes of fudge and chocolate. Creamy and chocolatey. Whiskey kicks in with strong oak and it dries out with a boozy finish. Aftertaste is just shy of soy sauce again. Heavy and slow to drink. It's very good. I say that begrudgingly."

Beer:Barrel:Time,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32319/275206/,4.65,"750ml bottle of the 2017 release. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pour is a massively dark black body, one finger offwhite head, fair retention and no lacing as expected. Smell is rich. Really rich chocolate fudge, light smoke and bourbon, a lot of wet oak barrel and even a bit of vanillin, cocoa nibs, perhaps a little bit of espresso, sugar. It smells appropriately sweet. Flavour is a revelation; incredibly complex flavour profile of vanillin, oak, chocolate, cocoa, bourbon, slight char and smoke. This hits all the notes and very well it should. It's not particularly boozy, but the bourbon flavours just do so well in integrating with the stout. It's sweet, but doesn't taste sickly sweet. Mouthfeel is full bodied, substantial in body with a nice appropriate carbonation to it that is just enough without being overly prickly or flat. Tons of flavours from the beginning to the end, an easy one to ponder and sip on as it seems to change so much as it warms. There is a lot of hype behind this beer, and deservedly so. This checked off everything I could ever want in a non-adjunct, bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout."
Beer:Barrel:Time,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/32319/275206/,4.69,"It poured a super thick and viscous in the glass, pitch black color with very little head. Very little carbonation. The smell is sweet with tons of fudge interlace with bourbon and oak. Not complex by any means but so balance, sweet and rich. The flavor profile is just the same - so much rich chocolate fudge in the mouth balanced out with the warming touch of bourbon. Its sweet with a lot of depth that includes dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and bourbon; all the things you would dream of in a barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick and rich without much warmth for a 15% ABV beer. Overall: this is a superb beer, well remarkable for its balance of flavors, its depth of flavors and the thickness. Some may say its overrated because its not too different from other easy to obtain stouts. I have to disagree, it is well perfected with its sweetness, balance and the bourbon."

The barrel starts to make an assertive presence as well. I get some whiskey leather and tobacco that carry on throughout the finish. In the finish this beer is all barrel. Whiskey, oak, coconut, leather, tobacco, maple syrup, rye spice, and a touch of dark cherry round out this beautiful beer. The whiskey and barrel notes linger in the aftertaste.', 'Feel: Full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. The beer is smooth but drinks big. This is definitely a classic example of a sipper.', 'Overall: This is a wonderful beer that highlights everything a whiskey barrel has to offer. If you don’t like whiskey you probably won’t enjoy this because it is the start of the show. The whiskey barrel is really smooth and present but it never gets to hot and still allows for the beer to be there in the background. Overall this is a 100/100 to me, but is it worth the high trading price tag probably not. Barrel aged sump is just as good if not better in my opinion and it goes for a lot less. Still this is an amazing beer! That is worth getting if your willing to pay the price of admission."

It's still one of the better variants, amongst a collection of great brews, but not my favorite this year."

GOOD bourbon note and a very sticky thick mouthfeel.', 'As someone who’s had the past four Marshmallow Handjees and many other DL variants, this just may be the best one: Chemtrailmix 2018.

On draft and poured into plastic cups, which were then poured into my glass. Standard Dark Lord body, not much to be said about that. Smell is a massive cinnamon, slight spicy rye, brown sugar, a bit of burnt black coffee, a bit of umami, milk chocolate- recognizably Dark Lord underneath. The flavour is a bit more muddled, but the cinnamon remains huge, from the beginning to the end, contributing that cinnamon toasted crunch up front intermingling with the DL base, and combining well with the spicy rye barrel to bring more of a spice component on the backend. Peppercorns aren't as prominent as in 2017, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is full bodied, good carbonation, smooth and slightly silky, cinnamon spice on the finish. This is on the level of BA Abraxas in terms of the cinnamon, without the green pepper from the spices. I can see this one being the variant of the year."

As the beer moves into the finish it let’s you know it is a beer. More grapefruit zest and orange peel come through then the nose leads on and adds a noticeable bitterness.

The wait was long and the hype was probably more than it needed to be but here's my review. It pours as a golden yellow with a subtle hazy but mostly a clearer beer to say the least. The smell of the beer has a very pleasant hop aroma to it. The taste pretty well balanced between the hops and malt, reminding me of some of the original west coast IPA's that used to rule the beer world. The feel of this is actually a bit thinner than I expected, I suppose this was due to the increase in alcohol compared to how Double Sunshine feels.

The nose on thing thing is just dastardly and robust - think Karl Malden. I mean for real, this beer smells more ripe than Bar Rafieli’s pompoms.

Honestly just a massive flavor profile. Cherry, bitter dark chocolate, fudge, charred barley, chocolate malt, toasted nutty, molasses and chocolate covered raisin notes meet the rich coffee flavors mentioned. Decadent and a sipper.

Loved the iterations of the Double Shot that I traded for (with the same person) a few weeks back and this was just as good as those. The label describes this as being ""like a melted chocolate bar"" and that would be quite apt how rich, silky, and luscious this was. If you love Stouts of any kind, then this would easily be one worth seeking!', ""Good pour to this as the liquid was dark, smooth, and topped off with plenty of mocha head. A decent amount of lacing was left behind as I sipped it although it was quite splotchy as no easily visible rings were discernible. Loads of bright coffee, milk chocolate, cocoa powder, and coffee creamer were in the slightly muted nose as they emerged quite strongly in the taste. Espresso bean, raspberry slickness, boozy brandy, brown sugar, and booze (!) emerged on the palate once this fully warmed up. Sure, this packed a punch but it was so smooth and sweet that it was like the softest boxing gloves were put on before the blow was delivered. Lactose, and brown sugary sweetness came through before I finished this off as there was a powdery undertone to the silky smoothness that was this beer's hallmark."", ""Oddly enough, this felt stronger than it was in actuality, as it felt like a Breakfast Stout that was taken up a few notches. Not quite a dessert beer, this would be fine after dinner but there wasn't a lot of fruit or tartness to balance out the chocolate and coffee that formed this beer's backbone. I'll always love the canned beers from Tree House that I've been fortunate enough to get my hands on but along with their other bottles,this proved that all that glitters doesn't come in the form of aluminum. Well worth seeking out and taking the time to savor!"

I drank about a 1/4 of the bottle and then promptly re-capped it and then tucked it away in the fridge for later.', 'Revisited about a couple hours later and by then my palate (or less likely the beer) had changed and the notes of coconut and light vanilla were more present.

Bourbon Paradise,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/30356/314813/,4.45,"i wasnt the biggest fan of the original paradise, way too sweet and way too much vanilla, just totally over the top, comical proportions really, purely novelty sort of brew, at least for me, but this special barrel aged version improves it considerably i reckon, with the coconut really coming out, enhanced by the sweet whiskey and charred oak. i also get a lot more of the roasted grain character than i ever did in the base beer by itself, bitter with some coffee essence, rich still and absolutely sugary, even splitting a small bottle of this felt like a ton of beer, with the alcohol and the sugar just dripping out of it. cool nuance here, not all vanilla, some light smoke, some wet oak, good bourbon and charcoal, milk chocolate desserty vibes, and dried fruits like raisins and figs. the coconut is floral and new and nice, toasted and baked tasting, awesome with the vanilla, which tastes less syrupy and more natural here than it did in the original, owing to the barrel i reckon. huge body and a ton of booze, this is sludgy and thick and viscous to the max, but it lets all the flavors slowly and semi permanently coat the palate, and its pretty agreeable to me overall. maybe not quite worthy as one of the top beers in the world, that seems like a stretch for it, but a special treat nevertheless and another cool one from prairie. huge thanks to my buddy for sharing this one with me, a rarity indeed! diabetic but delicious."

Saint Lamvinus,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/388/8954/,4.62,"Poured a non-translucent light purple color - almost like diluted grape juice. Very little head on presentation. The smell is tart, dry and vinous with a whiff of grape skins and oak. Some funk pushing through in the nose. The taste is so balanced and easy to drink. It's tart, dry (not as dry as many of their other fruit lambics), mildly sour with just a slight oak mustiness and notes of fresh grapes skins. While it is an overall dry lambic, there is some sweetness from the grapes that balances out the tartness. It has a medium bodied mouthfeel with just mild acidity, not too harsh. Overall, one of the better Cantillon's I've tried. It really stands out for being well balanced. While it used Merlot grapes, I wouldn't describe the beer having a taste resembling the qualities of Merlot (leathery and dark fruits), however this is a 2014 bottle and it may differ from a fresher version. It does have a nice vinous quality which I assume are from the Merlot grapes."

Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of complexity of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic tartness; light fruit tang and yeast/oak spiciness on the finish.

Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/tartness balance, and zero puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from tartness and tangy/tannic fruit/oak. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and acidic/tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an excellent fruit lambic. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modestly lactic/tangy/tannic/drying finish. Well rounded Brett complexity and solid Lacto presence. Perfectly balanced between grapes, oak, and malts. Was expecting way more out of this. Not as much depth in funky complexity, and not as jammy/vinous on fruit character as I wanted. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example otherwise."

The tastes of orange, passionfruit, and guava are unashamedly fantastic, and that alcohol level does not cross the palate immediately, further making my pint dangerously drinkable. It's full bodied and very smooth, and already being such a great beer, felt that this beer was not playing fair."", ""Keene Idea is a beer that I'm sure made Dave Keene smile from ear to ear.

Aroma is earthy papaya, tangerine and grapefruit with a little stone and yeast beyond. It's tropical fruit opening lingers for a while, letting the base pale ale (which is already very hoppy) show throw in fragments. Aroma is akin to a very powerful NE IPA. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, mango, tangerine with a little earthy, nutty malt and raw grain and yeast to sooth things out. It's tropical fruit through and through, and drinks very similar - identical - to Trillium's Northeast IPA (this is labeled as an American Pale Ale at the time of review). All this to say, it's incredible hop forward, much more so than other pale ales, which may be a deterrent for some. Mouth feel is a little gritty, silty and soft, with a medium-thick consistency. It's liken to a well-worn lumpy, linen pillow. Overall, despite a slightly misleading style, the name of the beer lets those knowledgeable about beer that the hop content is going to be high, thus I will not knock it for the style mis-interpretation.

The Broken Truck,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/31540/173144/,4.75,B2. This is De Garde's masterpiece and probably the best American lambic out there. Taut and fruitier than most Belgian gueuezes without fruit. Slightly funky and sure to age with grace. Wish I had B1 now since most are saying it is better.
The Broken Truck,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/31540/173144/,4.98,The more I look back on this beer the more I love it. It was probably one of the most complex beers I've ever had. Perfect amount of funk and taste. The aftertaste sits with you for a long time. I had no. 2. It was very delicious.

Aroma is quite funky with overripe peach and farmhouse notes. Taste is dry, funky with aspirin notes. Light, effervescent body. I also had a sample from the second batch a year ago and it was pretty much the same. I still don't understand why it's so highly regarded. Many other de Garde beers are much better."

There is the funky brett yeastiness, then there is just enough sweet malt backbone that makes it impossible to forget it's in your mouth. What I find lacking in Hill Farmstead saisons--great beers, they are--is the perfect malt sweet balance that I find in this behind the funk. Just beautiful. Super easy drinking, but not too light bodied, medium plus carbonation, and oh so good. Among the best beers I have ever had. Going to be hard to drink any other saison after this one.

It's actually quite difficult to get past these two very distinctive aromas as they're very unapologetically in your face, but some subtle hints of lemon zest, barnyard funk, and milky caramel-like lactose surface with some time. Bretty notes of horseblanket and hay intensify as the brew gets even warmer."", ""Whether or not the SARA had this specific vision in mind, I think the beer itself is an embodiment of the Apricot as a whole, from the inside out, in terms of the flavor. Allow me to elaborate.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThe first impression that the beer imparts on the tongue is mouth-puckeringly tart, as if you're sucking on a whole apricot pit by itself. Before there's any time to dwell on the sudden sour influx, a nice juicy apricot wave with a supporting cast of lactic acid and oak--this is the flesh of the apricot. The brew has a well-rounded sweet fruity finish, reminiscent of juicy nectarines, much like the sensation you get when you chew on the skin of the apricot."", ""Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. The abundance of fruit in this beer really accentuates the creamy mouthfeel that SARA magically imparts upon their ales; at one point I could have sworn there was milkshake traveling down my throat as opposed to a very well-made American Wild Ale from a town that people from Santa Cruz go to when they need clothes that aren't hipster or from the Salvation Army, since Santa Cruz is adamantly reclusive about allowing corporations and non-local into the town."

More prevalent oaky pinot noir aroma fades as it warms, succumbing to the tart, juicy fruitiness. Bits of lemon and citrus, but nothing overly acidic.', 'T: Tons of tart apricot up front. The apricot notes change tremendously as it warms, becoming sweeter and incredibly juicy. The final sips tasted like straight apricot juice--absolutely insane. Bits of musty, cheese-rindy funk, but mostly just zesty, tart, juicy fresh fruit. Apricot is, of course, dominant, but but supporting roles are also played by green apple, lemon, and peach.', ""M: Medium bodied feel with bright, effervescent carbonation that glides across the tongue. Not a particularly creamy beer, but the unfiltered nature of the beer adds a certain weight to it. It has medium plus sourness, but nothing overly acidic. It's quite dry from the start yet so clean, making for an extremely drinkable sour."", ""O: I feel slightly embarrassed to say it, but this is one of the first sours I've truly sat down to enjoy and review.

An incredible balance of tart, juicy fruit, oak barrel, and musty, rindy funk blends with an effervescent yet delicate feel to provide an incredible drinking experience.

West Ashley,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28019/84772/,4.36,"On tap at the source in Capitola. To me, this was basically Saison Bernice with apricots added, aged in oak. It is a pleasant combo. You have the base saison adding a full body, nice carbonation / effervescent mouthfeel, slight funk, lacto. This one is quite tart, but I wouldn't call it sour. The apricot addition wasn't that apparent in the nose, but it did round off and pair with the base saison and oak flavors very well. I was surprised to find out that this was aged in a pinot noir barrel, because I didn't pick up any specific presence, just oak really. It goes down with a significant tart bite, leaving your mouth dry and aftertaste of tart lemon, oak, and hint of apricot. I really enjoyed drinking this and would happily have again. But, jesus it was a pain to get over here from the peninsula and unfortunately that means it will be a long while since I enjoy some SARA treats again. Sante!"

To provide some context to better explain my woe: I had already bought seven bottles of CCB-Bomb at this point, and had put aside two to send to Korea and to my #hopbae--the impending guilt from having to perhaps send two of my most cherished beer acquaintances a bad beer was to say the least, nerve-wracking.', ""So you can imagine the odd mixture of elation, relief, and somehow, arousal when I finally decided to pop open a bottle to see how it fared compared to the draft.

That's kind of how I feel right now; it's like I am absolutely certain (even more so now) that this beer is nothing but cash money, but I'm kind of afraid no one else I sent this beer to might have been able to perceive it.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nEither way, the recipe calls for equal parts coffee, cinnamon, and the B-Bomb mixture (tree bark, chocolate, raisins, dark fruits, vanilla) on the palate. The coffee sticks to your lips while the cinnamon kinda lingers near the back of your throat, with the leather-y, bourbon-y, moist chocolate brownie flavors of B-Bomb fill up everything in between. There is a tiny bit of fusel-alcohol detectable on the tongue as well, but it's nothing to get too irked about.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nMedium bodied with a dreamy creamy mouthfeel. It's certainly not hefty or chewy by any sense, but every sip sticks and lingers on top of your lips like a crazy possessive ex-GF with boundary issues.

The roasted malt was tucked away in the nose.', 'Taste was a well integrated easy drinking affair relatively speaking. The coffee melded well as it had been a few years since it was fresh. The bourbon really revealed a great job of blending the different ages of barrels. Mild chocolate, leather, tobacco and bark notes. This is similar to backwoods bastard with some adjuncts in it. Well done. The PacNW seemed like the last region to get bourbon barrel beers going into production in any serious amount of numbers, so its only natural on here that the scores for that stuff would be inflated (see east coast/middle of nowhere ipas). So while I can vouch this is a very good beer, its not quite elite world class tier, but it is damn good."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/20680/149554/,4.56,"2016 vintage - I lucked in to a few bottles of Fremont vintages while on a trip to Denver for Great American Beer Fest. I was just a bit ecstatic, as you might imagine. Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb was one of those beers - and while I had zero experience with Fremont at the time, I'd read reviews and was excited to try it."", 'But then it disappeared in to the cellar.', ""So, I had a bottle of Coconut B-Bomb recently and realized - hey, I have all of these bottles of Fremont to enjoy. I really should do that! So Coffee Cinnamon came out for a friend's going away party. My impressions: the beer is quite dark, but has a nice half a finger's head of light tan. It smells strongly of coffee and cinnamon. The taste is very cinnamon forward, but I suspect the coffee has faded a bit (no experience with fresher bottles to judge - just a suspicion). The coffee flavors have remained good though - no traces of vegetal flavors, no oxidation evident, all good here. The barrel is also quite nice and really complements the light spicy sweetness of the cinnamon."", ""This had me wondering how CC Bomb compares to Barrel Aged Abraxas. Friends just laughed at me, but... really, I'm curious. I hope to do a side-by-side some day."

After having this and Morning Wood last week it makes me wonder how long they age these in barrels.

Mexican Brunch,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/26676/173480/,4.51,"I'd heard the chatter about the 2017 gusher bottles--and holy hell I can't believe there was a full refund to purchasers even though testing showed there was no sign of infection, just some nucleation from the spices--but my bottle was cool as a cucumber and didn't even begin to fizzle up as I opened it."", 'The pour is deep brown with black ribbons, filling to black, with a very large, dense creamy tan foam settling to a persistent creamy tan blanket with a clinging soft collar.', 'As it pours, an abundant, enveloping aroma of freshly ground coffee fills the room! Coming in closer, deeply caramelized brown sugar spikes up--identical to intentionally burning it at the bottom of the pot when prepping for Mexican coffee. A touch of vanilla with darkly intense and brooding notes of cinnamon bark nears fried French Toast, but also pulls towards savory mole, yet stays in between both somehow, with a faint hint of roasted chili smoke.', ""OMG the flavor is incredible! A slight hint of smoke and spice from the chili pepper pops in for a brief appearance, but a metric shit ton of dark roast coffee, almost dusty, but mostly earthy, nutty, and chocolatey, absolutely dominates. That amazing caramelized brown sugar kicks in, with decadent accents of cinnamon that simulates an artisanal cinnamon roll, all finishing smoky. I'm similarly perplexed here as I was with Sunday Brunch, even moreso now that there is the added element of chilies, because I'm not sure what contributes the smoke, but it's an excellent yet modest addition."", 'The body is smooth and round, medium to full, with a fine, wonderful carbonation that only slightly expands in a rounded way on the palate, before giving a slight tang with a semi-dry finish.', ""I liked Sunday Brunch slightly more. This had such a potent kick of coffee by comparison, it was a little overwhelming, but it may be because I opened it just after bottling. The two are very, very similar to each other though, and the Mexican element really only comes through moreso in the caramelized brown sugar, and less so in the chilies. Now, I may be associating caramelized brown sugar where it could in fact be maple. Whatever the case, it's unbelievably delicious, yet still somehow balanced and not at all cloying, just like Sunday Brunch."", '---', ""In December 2018 I had a 2016 bottle of Mexican Brunch and found it to be way more chocolatey than the more recent versions I've enjoyed. The cacao nibs really left their mark while everything else faded while some roasted chillies were more apparent. It was good but I love the direction they've taken it, only upping he quality."

It just taste like any other dark beer but with an awful hard to swallow bitterness. I'm so annoyed with this beer right now. If it hadn't cost $10 and if it was 13% alcohol (something I didn't realize until after I bought it) I'd have thrown it out already.

It reminded me of drinking Dundee\'s Honey Brown Lager back in high school. I was tempted to ""accidentally"" spill my glass off his deck to avoid further punishment, but there were kids underneath playing laser tag, and I was afraid of spilling it on them. Imagine having to rescue them from a bee attack or a bear attack if they were laced in Cutting Tiles. I thoroughly enjoyed the other varieties, but the 4.5 point World Class reviews for this beer are completely misleading. I think the beer is just riding the coattails of Trillium\'s other quality recipes. I desperately want to blind taste test some users on this site. This beer is terrible. Save yourself the drive, buy a double Mosaic IPA that somehow tastes like a pilsner, and stir in about a half a cup of honey and there you go, Cutting Tiles. Also, if you like tea and honey, try tea and Cutting Tiles. Oh, and I heard they\'re partnering with General Mills to make Cutting Tiles Nut Cheerios.

It forms in the glass black with a bright brown highlighted rim. It wanted to form a crown of caramel bubbles on the pour, but never could muster it. 4', 'The nose carries in a bourbon barrel that wants its presence known. It shows dark fruit; raisins, dates and plums alongside a dry oak, light leather and vanilla tannins. The cinnamon is at the party, but deciding if it wants to dance yet. 4.25', 'And with one sip, the cinnamon jumps off the wall to dance, providing an ever so slight spicy tingle. It doesn’t take long for the barrel to come back in with its dark fruit. Loads of chocolate paints the background and stays throughout. I think the licorice adds to the overall taste, but it’s not something that would be picked out if not noted. The only time I’m able to tell it’s there is maybe on the finish with a little lingering candy sweetness. 4.5', 'The 14.5% ABV seems like an 8 or 9%, it’s very soft and subtle, which is very impressive for how evident and prominent the barrel is throughout. It’s very well integrated in there with no booze showing through. Cinnamon bark provides a nice, slight tingle throughout. I would put this at medium bodied, and if it was a little thicker my rating on the feel would be perfect. 4.5', 'Overall, this isn’t a beer that is going to obliterate your mouth with flavor. It sits back, and slowly shows you beautiful aspects throughout its entirety. Very well made, balanced & integrated. It honestly reminds me of something Bells would make. In the sense that, it might leave you wanting a little more of a certain aspect at given points, but it definitely won’t leave you saying it wasn’t perfectly balanced. 4.5"

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/396/31484/,4.21,"September 3rd, 2015 - The Alesmith Vietnamese Coffee stout is a premier beer, but the Bourbon Barrel Aged version is no slouch. With a smooth, opalescent look it offers classic and classy alcohol and oak notes, smoldering with ethanol. The taste is much gentler, both sweet and delicate, but also bold and robust. A licorice sweetness mixes with the taste of Japanese whisky, and a thinner palate let's everything shine through."

But the coffee presence itself, I dunno, I've literally had dozens of better coffee beers, much less coffee stouts. Some dude said these were $8 a can, but I don't recall seeing that when I got mine. Mouthfeel was good, alcohol wasn't problematic. I liked it and will look forward to cracking the other 3 cans of it. I dunno, sometimes my nose isn't working good, but I wasn't tasting it either, perhaps I will revise the aroma upward if that is the case."

Grey Monday,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/16866/74295/,4.08,"In the interest of fairness, I am not a huge fan of hazelnut. There is something of putting about the overall profile. That said, at the front the thick boozing this is very apparent. Lingering about the mouth, the hazelnut was very easy to detect. The field was very sticky and sweet, swinging easily to the sides of the mouth. The feel was almost chewy. Raisins and dark fruit were also present. Yet in the overall scheme of things, the hazelnut make this hard for me to like."
Grey Monday,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/16866/74295/,4.54,To me this tastes like a slightly smoother more chocolatey black tuesday.

Grey Monday,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/16866/74295/,4.3,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/4/2016. Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger foamy khaki head with poor retention, and reduces to nothing pretty quickly. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Plenty of alcohol legs on the glass. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, hazelnuts, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, raisins, and roast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, hazelnuts, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, hazelnuts, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, raisins, and roast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate bourbon/oak spiciness and light roasted bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, hazelnuts, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, raisins, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, hazelnuts, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness and roast bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and fairy full body; with a smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/syrupy/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden; a small lingering warmth, with mild booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, hazelnuts, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the enormous ABV. I was hoping for more intense hazelnut character from this; but it seems to be much more balanced between the malt, barrel, and hazelnut flavors. A highly enjoyable offering regardless."

Pours a yellow color with some hop haze going through it, 1/2"" white head. Smell those Citra hops, they\'re in no small quantity here. But even that amount of Citra can\'t compete with the imperial dank march of the Nelson hop. And for comparison, I just reviewed Nelson the Greeter from Port, and this blows the doors off that beer. And I\'m a guy born in San Diego, the anti-homer. Just crushes you with all kinds of tangerine, papaya and marijuana dankness all over this beer.', ""Taste is pretty dope too. All that citrus and tropical fruit flavor over a body that is supportive, but offers no clashing flavors.

Consecration,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/45653/,4.52,"Russian River Brewing Co. ""Consecration""\n375 ml brown glass bottle, corked and caged, ""BOTTLED ON:100316"" and sampled on 040718\n$15.99 @ The Beer Yard (The Beverage Store), Wayne, PA', ""Notes via stream of consciousness: This isn't the first time I've had Consecration, and it probably won't be the last, but expensive bottles are few and far between for me these days, especially when there are so many new beers out there as well. This, however, has always been a favorite for me, even within the Russian River family of beers so here goes... it's brown in color beneath a very short-lived head of off-white foam. It disappears almost immediately, but that's common for sour beers. As this was a long standing bottle all of the sediment was finely packed and remained at the base of the bottle and it's quite clear. It has some very nice ruby highlights to it. In the nose it's fruity and oaky, vinous and funky. It reminds me of a Flemish brown ale but different. The flavor follows with some added maltiness that's got some caramel to it, and a stiff bitterness. The currant is clear but not too bright, blending in with the rest of the beer so that it becomes one rounded flavor rather than pieces that aren't so finely put together. This one has it all, Brettanomyces, Pediococcus, and Lactobacillus and it shows - yet at the same time it's very refined, there must be some good blending going on in its production. It's earthy, a bit leathery, kind of grassy like wet straw, and even slightly metallic. It's not too tart or sour though, and I don't think that many would be turned away by it. Well, at least people who knew they were going to drink a sour beer, and unlike many other sour beers there is some bitterness there as well. But is that from hops or the currant? And it really is the currant that really makes this work, and what makes it stand out. I don't think I've ever had a currant beer either before or after this, and it's really unusual. It's so refreshing and livening, and although it's a little like dark cherries and black grapes it's really something different altogether. In the mouth it's medium in body and delicately effervescent and caressing. Wow, what a special beer. This is absolutely world class. Even the best Belgian sour producers would have to look at this with at least a little bit of awe. Haha, so I've reminded myself that even though it's expensive, it's really worth it. I could spend the same amount and get twice as much volume in a fairly good wine, but would it satisfy me as much? No, for me, I'm sure of that. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant, I'm not sure what else to say. Seek it out.\nReview# 5,933"

The second batch was better than the first because it had a much stronger coffee presence. The first batch was more maple dominated whereas the taste of the second batch is more coffee dominant. I definitely prefer the second batch as it is sweet enough and the coffee does a great job of balancing out the sweetness from the maple syrup.

Light-moderate increasing warmth of 28%, some lingering barrel booze after the finish; but not overwhelming. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged strong ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the enormous ABV.

Harsh and lots of heat lingers. This feels more like whisky than beer, though it is surprisingly silky and smooth, especially as it settles.', 'OVERALL: This is closer to straight spirit than any other incarnation of this beer. Either that or I’ve become a huge sissy since I last had one of these a couple years back. Probably a combination of the two. It seems like the extra barrel aging, which was totally unnecessary in the first place, has made this one even hotter and boozier than the base. Amazing, but yes, it’s boozier than the base. I’m never sure what to think about this bruiser. I admit I find it rather delicious and actually crave it from time to time, but it’s questionable at best as an imperial stout, and as a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout, I often wonder where the stout went. From my notes and memory the 2009 original bottling was one of the best things to ever grace my belly, and unfortunately the successors haven’t quite lived up to that heavenly experience. All that said, this is probably the beer I most look forward to imbibing in again. Weird. Enjoyable for sure, but be ready with an army of the willing at your back, or a solid wine stopper so you can plug it up and enjoy it for a couple weeks. Thanks again, claaark! Always a pleasure."

The aftertaste of fresh, dry hops keeps going long after the last sip. Obviously complexity is vety high concidering the quality and balance of malt/hops. The ale yeast is always very neautral and clean, which allows the hops to shine and malt to hold it all down. You would never know this is 8.5% abv. Because of the heady complexity and dry tones.

Some might argue the people are loud and flamboyant, they steal our women, the succer players melodramatically flop on the pitch. Listen - that\'s all part of the secret Italian ingredient - keep it cool, confident, arrogant and extravagant. Forza Italia."" Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout, brewed with natural flavor and aged in Bourbon Barrels. Available in 22 oz. bottles and on limited annual release draft.', 'Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a snifter glass.', '(Appearance) Pours a rich, dark chocolate head of a crisp frothy consistency over a jet black, moderately viscous body. Retention is below average and lacing is light and patchy. 4', '(Smell) Chocolate wafers, light caramel malt body and a delicate roast with overtones of Bourbon notes and a touch of sharp alcohol heat. The aroma of the body is perceptibly light yet appealing. Potency is moderate. 3.75', '(Taste) Velvety, nutty chocolate forward with smooth caramel and vanilla undertones, finishing on a smooth transition to a slick, strongly flavored back end of bourbon flavor and soft heat. Nicely flavored in all the right places- surprisingly light drinking with a deceptively high ABV. The bourbon is very well integrated into this beer. 4.25', '(Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, moderately oily, lightly chewy, smooth, medium dry. Carbonation is modest, generating a medium frothiness and a mildly crisp finish. Body is medium for the style, heavy overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to earthy roast bitterness and bourbon alcohol. Alcohol presence is moderate and there are no off characters. 4.5', ""(Overall) Integrating bourbon into an already thoroughly enjoyable Imperial Stout does help complicate (for the better) the drinkability of this otherwise highly drinkable and nicely balanced Imperial Stout, graduating it to a more graceful, slower sipping beer, expected of a quality Imperial Stout. The subtleties of this beer are widespread, with the focus remaining equally on the chocolate and bourbon, this beer does not lose any of its focus. One of the prized annual releases in EvilTwin's lineup and worthy of seeking out whenever it comes into town. A marked and welcome improvement over Imperial Biscotti Break standard and certainly worth the extra couple of bucks. 4.25"", ""Evil Twin Brewing's\nImperial Biscotti Break: Bourbon Barrel Aged\n4.14/5.00"

I had heard the hype and was excited to try it. I'm not going to say it disappointed me but it certainly did not live up to the hype. Again , not a bad brew but not worth the price point and not up to the talk. Nice aroma and coffee/chocolate are there but kinda weak IMO. Being in Jersey maybe I'm spoiled by Kane's Porters/Stouts - which are clearly superior - but this one didn't do it for me."

Incredibly thick, black brew with minimal head/carbonation. Smells of bourbon and the wood flavor really comes through more than most RIS. It has this strong coating and chewiness as well. Absolutely spectacular among stiff competition."
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24300/104699/,4.33,"Tons of dark chocolate and bourbon in the nose. Also a little vanilla, leather, and faint coffee. The taste starts off with more of the big chewy chocolate, accompanied by some nice bourbon heat. Unfortunately around mid-palate, there is a noticeable drop-off in the flavor profile. Subtle notes of vanilla and oak can be found, but the overall complexity (or lack thereof) keeps this just outside elite status in my opinion. Although the heavy fudgy chocolate on the front end gives a nice impression of viscous creaminess, it seems to finish a bit thin for the style. I will say I was quite impressed by the abundance of bourbon character, without feeling boozy or overwhelming. Overall, it's very very good, and I'd happily drink another."

Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24300/104699/,4.18,"This was a significant improvement on the base beer. Like the base, it tastes of licorice, raisins, and almonds. Some chocolate comes through as well. Its very rich on the nose and flavor. The base tastes course and artificial to me, but the bourbon barrel helps to smooth that out. I get a little vanilla from the barrel and I really like how the bourbon integrates with the base beer. The bourbon flavor is pleasant without excess booziness. The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium and there is a little chalkiness that detracts from the feel. Overall, its a very good beer with a few flaws."

Pours a viscous motor-oil black forming a thin sliver of dense head dark mocha head. The head is finely dotted with thin bubbles, recedes exceedingly slowly, and has excellent retention, leaving moderate lacing. The nose on this beer is bourbon through and through. Chocolate notes are unmistakeable, along with a sweet-biscuit - almost cookie - element that is decidedly unique. The palate follows the nose, opening with boozy bourbon, milk and dark chocolate, and an almost chocolate-chip-cookie-like flavor. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy - not quite on par with the best-of-the-best BB Imp Stouts, but solid. If you had told me that this beer was a slightly more subtle and bourbon barrel aged part of the Southern Tier Blackwater series, I'd hardly be surprised - there's the faintest hint of artificial in the flavoring here: not enough to ruin what is otherwise a very good beer, but enough to be noticed. Ultimately, the various elements of this beer come together to make a very well done Imp Stout. Top of its class? No. Overpriced and overhyped? Without a doubt. But another solid brew from Evil Twin?

That said, when you charge $25 a bottle, I expect a little something extra to set itself apart, and I can't say this fits that bill. If this were, say, $16 a bottle, I'd highly recommend it.

Lightly increasing dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness and roast bitterness. Medium carbonation and very full body; with a smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Lightly increasing warmth of 19.9%, with mild lingering barrel booziness after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. Bruery stouts always seem to have a class of their own on the flavor profile. Not as deeply roasty or charred on black/roasted malts like some others; but still extremely rich and complex. Outstanding barrel integration and balance; without feeling overly boozy, tannic, or drying. Very similar to the base beer with big levels of fruity/nutty coffee complexity.

A massive thanks goes out to cmrillo for bringing this one out during his own 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Can’t believe I FINALLY got to try this one!!! 2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, dark chocolate, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, wood, sweet alcohol, and milk chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. This was another one that I was shocked to see come out at the birthday party. This was sampled directly after Stormaktsporter. There was a pretty good difference in this one from the base brew. There was a lot more presence of the vanilla with an addition of various chocolate aspects. The cigar aspect I picked up on in the base brew had disappeared, but what replaced it in both the flavor and aroma was just plain excellent.

I was certainly happy to make the trip down to get the chance to try this well regarded brew – I figured this may be my only chance!', '2008 version, 250ml bottle into a snifter.', ""The pour looked great. There's a dark beer with some chocolate and midnight hues swirling around the glass. A touch of head quickly dissipates but that's to be expected with a big barrel aged brew like this. The beer looks thick and, while there's no lace, this is a very appealing glass."", 'The smell is complex and shows that this is well crafted. There’s a nice bourbon and barrel edge that charges through first, then, once that brute force element dies away, there are some nice smoky notes that integrate well with the roasted malt. Not really burnt, coffee or chocolate dominated, the delicate balance is pretty remarkable. The barrel does stand out but not in a way that dominates. I’d have to say the smell is my favorite part of this beer.', 'The taste is also all about depth and complexity. The barrel has again taken the lead, but the honey in the base beer makes this very unique and adds some flower and compliments the sweet chocolate notes very well. The hint of smoke and char allows this to again tip back towards balance, as the beer really straddles the line between sweet and bitter, boozy and balanced. A warming alcohol note towards the end is a bit out of place, but at 10% this beer has a ton of flavors and is certainly not a booze bomb. A touch more integration and slightly different flavor profile would make this score higher from me. I guess I like beers with a touch more personality or that lean one way or another. This does a great job encapsulating many elements, but the tradeoff is less personality. Not overrated per say, but also not my favorite of the mega-whales I’ve been fortunate enough to try.', 'The mouthfeel is just a bit thin compared to the biggest, baddest stouts out there. That being said, the touch of carbonation kisses my tongue with just enough vigor to keep the beer interesting and let the subtleties pop.', 'Overall, this beer is a work of art. There’s no denying the craftsmanship that went into it. That being said, it wasn’t my favorite BA stout, even of the evening, and it may suffer just a bit from inflated expectations. Absolutely worth a try but not at any cost."
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10902/42664/,4.5,"First had this one at the 2010 BOREFTS Festival at De Molen in Bordegrave, Holland. Along with the base beer and two other barrel aged variants, the Narke stouts were one of the highlights of the festival for me. Was also lucky enough to be able to buy a bottle at the festival to take away, and Doopie was so generous to let me have his to take home. Thanks again bro.', 'From a 25cl bottle bottle into a snifter\nVintage: 2009\nDrunk directly after a 2008 base Stormaktsporter', 'APPEARANCE: A black pour, slightly darker than the base, makes a medium sized, medium-thick tan head that fades rather quickly. A wisp and bubbly ring are left behind. Jet black body and zero carbonation evident. A ring remains until the end and leaves some dots of lacing down the glass. Much the same as the base, though slightly darker pour.', 'SMELL: Roasted malts with plenty of bourbon for sure. Oak and vanilla play a role, as well as some hints of milk chocolate. Medium strength; not as bold as the base beer, but definitely strikes a superb balance between the roasted malt base and the barrel.', 'TASTE: Much more impressive than the nose, and this is where the beer makes a name for itself. Roasted malts up front with some milk chocolate and sweet molasses before the barrel kicks in. Bourbon, oak and vanilla show up in full force after the swallow, but it still leaves room for the roasted malt foundation of the base beer. Very well put together with a touch of heat after the swallow. Bold and lingering aftertaste of roasted malts, molasses, and the bourbon barrel all work together very well. Great stuff, with just the right amount of heat at the swallow.', 'PALATE: Same as the base beer. Medium body and carbonation, and very creamy smooth on the palate. Goes down smooth with a touch of heat and an alcohol bite at the swallow. Finishes slightly mouth-coating. Nice and creamy for sure.', 'OVERALL: Again, these 25cl bottles are just unfair, especially when split up. They need to start filling 750s and sending them to my house. One of the most balanced and flavorful bourbon barrel aged stouts on the planet. Nothing dominates, allowing the great roasted base beer to combine beautifully with the barrels. A touchstone in the style. Whether this is better than the base Stormaktsporter is really moot point, as one is world class stout, and the other is a world class barrel aged stout. Drink them both if you get the chance. Thanks again for this opportunity Doops."

Big thanks to Masterski for getting me this bottle, one that I've wanted to try for a long time but never pulled together a trade (thanks a ton Alex!)."", ""I shared this at a tasting in northern OH, a pretty exceptional Tuesday night. Dark brown and faintly translucent, with the thinnest of foams on top. The aroma is quite nice, but to be honest I was expecting so much that I was actually a little disappointed. Taking the expectations out of it this was very good. Less roasty than I would have thought, this had more tobacco and leather to it than stouts normally do. Earthy, that's probably the correct adjective."", ""Some dark fruits in the flavor, plum/raisin type of thing, with lots of earthy character (I think I'm liking this term a lot). Not as strong tasting a stout as I expected, this was nothing like bourbon stouts in the USA aspire to be. Much more nuanced, less easily appreciated I think. That said I enjoyed searching out the flavors."", ""Lighter than expected but not thin bodied. Very very good, and obviously I'm very happy to have had a chance to try it. I'm also glad I shared it with some others so more can try this rarity, although with the small size of the bottle I could easily have taken it myself at home."

A lot of beers talk about their pie like qualities but this one pushes cherry pie weight like no other. Any acidity is restrained as can be. Oak is mild, spontaneous funk notes are as well.

The smell started off with sweet to robust and roasty coffee and cocoa moving slowly into a real nice malty aroma. The taste rolled into the sweetness nicely with a fairly sweet to roasty with a tad of bitter coffee blending nicely. There’s a nice semi-sweet to roasty aftertaste bleeding into a semi-dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a fairly nice sessionability about it. Carbonation runs nicely underneath fulfilling a fairly light quality but not too light.

Loads of Mosaic, dankness, grass, and forest in the muted nose as they all came through in the taste. Nothing heavy here and the Barley stood out more than anything else in the taste, as this felt quite full but uninspiring at the same time.

It's highly aromatic with roasted malt, oatmeal, bourbon, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel, nuts, cocoa, tobacco, and earthy char. The taste opens with notes of both fresh and burnt coffee, oats, bakers chocolate, burnt nuts, leather, and char. As the glass breathes and warms, I'm noticing more caramel sweetness and just a hint of black cherry on the tip of the tongue. The bourbon is clearly evident but it doesn't overpower the other flavors, which are nicely balanced and nuanced. Despite the burnt notes there is surprisingly little bitterness at the finish. This Stout has a thick, creamy mouth feel with low/moderate carbonation. There is no escaping the 13.6% ABV, which is more than just warming. Sip this one slowly. Savor it because it is one of the best Oatmeal Stouts you'll encounter. Thanks, @woemad for the chance to drink this exquisite Stout."

I personally wish there was a bit more acidity, as there is not really any puckering factor here, but there is still some nice, musty, oaky funk characteristics and some softer fruit overtones like peach and nectarine.

Double Stack,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/41869/189180/,4.43,"Every Summer, I make this frustrating mistake of thinking that I’m actually going to spend the entirety of the three four high climate months crushing can after can of refreshing Pale Ales or IPAs. This misconception usually results in me doing something stupid like buying multiple four packs of the same beer thinking that the hot weather will help me power through the beers, and make them feel enjoyable all at the same time, while completely discounting such variables as (1) the fact that the human appetite decreases during warmer seasons; (2) my taste buds seem to get burned out from hops a lot faster in the summer; and, (3) regardless of the season, I’m usually too tired to drink a large quantity of beer after work, so I tend to reach for the higher ABV beers than the lower.', 'So until those three variables are somehow resolved internally, I usually find myself doing the exact opposite of what I think I would normally be doing in terms of drinking during the Summer months: instead of crushing session IPAs, wheat beers, and bretty saisons, I end up fruitlessly trying to solodome bombers of BA stouts and passing out with over half the beer still left in the glass; or drinking one 12oz bottle of a high ABV stout and trying to start another lower ABV IPA and then passing out with over three-fourth of the beer still left in the glass; or actually finishing two tall boys of an IPA, going to bed at like 12:30 AM and waking up tired and hungover.', 'My idiosyncratic drinking habits formed from my highly functional alcoholism aside, it seems like a single 16oz can of a moderately high ABV stout is usually right around my happy spot of where I want to be when I’m too tired to do anything productive yet not tired enough to go to sleep—lucky for me my favorite brewery has made the ingenious decision of canning their most famous beer in tall boy format; unlucky for me, it’s so rich it’s almost taken me 5 weeks to finish a four-pack by myself.', 'When I heard that Mikerphone and Great Notion were brewing beers together, I was kind of hoping that their love child would be a cross between Smells Like Bean Spirit and Double Stack, kind of like what EvilTwin did with Westbrook with Imperial Biscotti Mexican Cake Break, but with less spice and more maple. And much less sticky cloying sweetness toward the back. I think they ended up putting out some strawberry IPA which I didn’t try because well, strawberry and IPA are not two words I ever want to see in the same sentence, as well as an imperial stout with peanut butter and marshmallows because I think the bottles were only put out in Chicago, and it was only briefly on tap if ever.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIf you haven’t gotten the hint by me wasting all this comment space while writing absolutely nothing about the actual beer itself, it’s because there’s nothing really to write about this beer: it’s coffee, maple syrup, pancake batter, and done. For posterity’s sake, I will go on record and point out that the beer also contains minor notes of whole grain pancakes which contains half-assedly molten dark cacao chocolate chips, but maple and coffee definitely are the two incredibly bold takeaways from this beer, and for anyone to miss it they’d have to absolutely no functional smell and taste receptors in their body at all.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nCompared to previous batches however, the body has become a lot more enjoyable, and by that I mean that it feels less like syrup and more like 99% humidity while being 102 outside on your skin/tongue. I’ve either become more accustomed to bold, sweet flavors, or Great Notion has wisely dialed down the pastrystout a little compared to their previous batches, so that even sugar averse sippers like myself can reach the bottom of the can, albeit very very slowly.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nI honestly don’t know how I’m going to finish the last remaining can inside my fridge."
Double Stack,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/41869/189180/,3.96,"Pours really nice with a relatively thick tan head. Smells wonderful, tons of maple followed by roasty coffee. Taste is underwhelming compared to the smell. Neither the maple nor the coffee is as strong as you would expect from the nose, and the base beer is not tasty enough to back them up. Some bitterness comes through, but it's almost burnt-tasting, not sure if that's from the malts or the coffee. Feel is not great. Not really very thick for an 11% stout, and it's a little over-carbed too. Overall, a fairly good beer, but disappointing. I would probably like it a lot more if I hadn't tasted other far-superior coffee/maple stouts like ISLBS and Imperial Falling Colors."

Aromas of fresh ground coffee, molasses, brown sugar, burnt coffee grinds, maple syrup, butter, cocoa powder, charred wood and sweet caramel or toffee notes. It teeters on too sweet, but is so rich and like an actual breakfast that it's wonderful to inhale. You can smell the brew in the glass from across the room."", ""The taste lived up to the hype. It was like dunking a syrup drenched pancake into a stout, then pouring the rest of the glass into the leftover syrup on the plate and tossing some coffee grinds in it. The roasty aspects and slight bitterness of the coffee dial down the sweetness to a reasonable level, but you'd better love maple syrup to drink this. The chocolate, roasted malts, burnt coffee, molasses and buttery notes from the aroma are also present in the flavor. This is craft beer at it's finest, as it's the total opposite of a macro brewed lager and yet made so well that it's delicious while hiding the 11% ABV masterfully. A nice chewy feel to the brew, it's so thick it has a syrup like resemblance. Outstanding overall."

The smell is very pungent and is dominated by maple. Taste follows the nose with tons of maple and hints of coffee, which comes out more as the beer warms. The body delivers about a medium mouthfeel, which might be this beer's weakest point. The carbonation is medium to high and the alcohol is well-hidden."

Double Stack,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/41869/189180/,4.55,"I had on tap a couple of weeks back, but happened to be in the Portland area during a release. Naturally, I grapped some cans to go. It was good on tap, but couldn't help but think the feel and aroma were weak compared to the hype. Let's see how the can compares, shall we?\nL: The beer pours our a uniform dark brown and near black. A 1/4 finger of a tan head formed from a standard and straight-centered pour. Moderate amounts of spotty lacing marks the glass as I consume this novelty beverage.\nS: Holy fuck. As soon as I opened the beer, it was like being exposed in a room filled ankle-deep with maple syrup. The maple is unreal, and honestly fills the surrounding space of my humble abode. Even my wife noted the maple smell from a distance. Despite maple being the star of the show, roasted coffee and malts are also detectible on the nose.\nT: As expected from the nose, the amount of maple makes you question if your existence was previously based on a maple tree-based beetle. Maple is present from the initial flavor to the very finish, and resides in an abundance in the aftertaste. Second to maple, molasses and coffee come next in a cascading order of events. The finish comprises an abundance of maple with underlying chocolate malts, molasses and nice black-coffee bitterness. Milk chocolate flavor also linger in the aftertaste.\nF: Full in body, heavy in weight. The carbonation levels are at the perfection point- slight fizz on the tongue but the beer still approaches chewy status. It is creamy, full, thick and delicious. Alcohol is completely hidden, making this beer a sweetly lethal offering. Zero alcohol presence, which is testimonial for an 11% brew.\nO: Can't say much other than this beer is phenomenal from the can. I am a huge fan of maple flavoring, and thankfully, the maple out weights the coffee by a long shot. On tap, I really enjoyed the beer; from the can, this beer is amazing. For 11 percent, this beer is the definition of a lethal weapon. Chocked full of sweet maple flavor and subtle milk chocolate with a malty finish. From the can, the beer tastes much more balanced and places a greater emphasis on maple syrup and other flavors than what I experienced on tap. I disagree with those that say it is unnatural tasting- its tastes natural, just with an abundance and overload of natural flavors than could be perceived as overwhelming. This beer is fucking great. I am very grateful I returned home with a couple cans. Cheers!"

Only a few spots of lacing was left behind as I worked my way through this as the residue on the side of my pint glass was quite disappointing. Tons of mango, citrus rind, booze, and yeast filled the nose although they were quite muted from the first whiff onward. Dank, pithy, and strong, tons of melon, cantaloupe, and kiwi came through as this warmed up but it was never easygoing enough for me to fully embrace. This had a creaminess and slickness to it that saved it from being a disappointment but it needed more sugar and tangerine from feeling too heavy, as the carbonation was nearly nowhere to be found...', 'No doubt that this had enough alcohol to it and it seemed to complement the subtle hop burn quite well. That wasn\'t what I was looking for as this beer put the ""heavy"" into heavy mettle.

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/396/75218/,4.37,"September 3rd, 2015 - When I leave San Diego, this will probably be the most memorable beer of the many, many beers I had. For one, I had it at one of my first visits to any brewery since moving to San Diego. But it is also an amazing brew. To the eye it looks like a somewhat intense stout, with a brown foam and a thick body, but not too oily. The aroma is big and bold, and cold and saturnine, like the smell of cold metal, but with some cacao nibs on the edge. The flavor is the real appeal here. Creamy, rich but not cloying, it is decadent, and deserving. Huge gushing chocolate notes combine with deluxe and top-shelf coffee notes, like Bird Rock coffee. Better yet, this beer gets spicier as it warms, like a Christmas ale, and reveals shades of nutmeg and cinnamon. Could this be a rare 10 for flavor?!"

Upper Case,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/30654/162357/,4.39,"Outstanding beer, and very different. Actually a very similar experience to Big Bird, which I lucked into two years ago as I picked up a flat of Trillium beers in Fort Point on our way to Cape Cod for a bi-annual multi-family trip. I think this one is actually more polished and tasty, fresh, than Big Bird was. But the amazing hop experience is similar. Looks like a muddy pineapple juice, but the aromas and (to a just slightly lesser degree) flavors cover just about every hop-related note I love about hoppy beers. Citrus, pith, berries, mango, musky wine grapes, dank hemp, tropical fruit, wheat biscuit, sugared grapefruit. Absolutely phenomenal. Grassy, but not overly so, which is a nice departure from most NE IPAs. Really nice level of sweetness, as well, and zero green astringency, even fresh, which distances this beer from Big Bird. Feel is a little thin, but that doesn’t take anything away from the amazing, complex, and harmonious nose and tongue. Amazing that you can throw an ungodly amount of different hops together and get such a wonderful end result."

Lots of mango, papaya, ripe fruit, and tropical hops in the nose as this had quite a heavy aroma, albeit not anything terribly strong. More hops, grape, white wine, faint wood, and hints of a Wild Ale came through in the taste as this was much more complex than I was first led to believe. This malted out for sure but the Pilsner, and Flaked Wheat Malt held on along with some of the Galaxy, as this was not light in body and had little carbonation to keep things lively..."", ""This wasn't light in booze either but it didn't knock me out at all.

Little bit of pine and some peanut skin bitterness close it out, along with the most mild ethanol flavor to help dry out all that sweetness.

Sweetness and bitterness are both dialed way up, but they keep each other in check so you barely notice how wonderfully extreme they are. Body is medium, which may be my only gripe with this beer... At 10%, I\'d like some more heft to my beers, whether it be carbonation or weight or something to just coat the mouth and do the intensity of flavor justice. Again, it seems they were going for creating the most ""drinkable"" TIPA, as I have had fuller takes on the style from them (DDH AGE, for one). But I really can\'t stress how impressively they\'ve concealed the alcohol on this one, especially given how fresh it is. Save for that mild ethanol flavor and a moderate dryness on the finish, I\'d have a hard time pinning this one above 8.5-9.0%.', 'O: It\'s been a pleasure to see OH evolve over the years, especially in their execution of triple IPAs. All Green Everything was the first beer I had from them, and it awoke my senses (literally) to what beer could be. Since then, they\'ve changed quite a bit, and most recently, seem to have really dialed in their execution of the NE style. This beer feels like an expression of that maturation. Despite its ABV, it\'s not as extreme as their earlier attempts, avoiding all of the pitfalls of palate fatigue and ""imbalance"" (ugh) that they struggled with in the past. It\'s big and bold and hopped out the wazoo, but it feels tighter and more carefully considered in the details. I\'ll let the use of ""QDH"" slide this time out of respect for the anniversary, but marketing fluff aside, this beer is truly well done and worthy of representing a great brewery\'s fourth rotation around the sun!"

Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/30654/245080/,4.6,"Galaxy is not one of my favorite hops - I'll be honest and just throw that out there."", ""That being said, there are things about galaxy that I do like quite a lot. When combined with other hops, it tends to be a smorgasbord of sweet, clean, rich haze. Cutting Tiles delivers in spades - it's almost too sweet, but it doesn't quite cross that border in to syrupy, which is good - I cannot abide that in an IPA. The beer is still plenty drinkable and doesn't have that filling quality that I hate. The bubble gum/cotton candy tasty that many attribute to galaxy is not all that forward - it's there, but not offensive or overwhelming."", ""I'd generally prefer a Fort Point - but this specific variant of Cutting Tiles is quite good."

This is so tasty and the honey only smoothing out the edges of the pine and sweet resin from the galaxy makes it even better. Perfect execution. The only tweak I would make to make it my number 1 beer ever (beats is infinite by monkish, a DDH All galaxy imperial IPA) would be to double dry hop this beer with more galaxy to bring out that grapefruit and grassy taste to the next level.

Huge aroma of weed, earthy smoked herbs and nuts. They carry over the taste, coupled with orange juice, lime, pithy and piney bitterness and a peppery alcohol bite. Some hop bite, too. Full bodied with a prickly feel. There’s a lot of depth and ton of alcohol in this one, but the nutty, smokey quality when fresh isn’t to my preference.

The new fermentation for these beers not only makes the hop flavors pop, but also smooths them out and they look great in the glass. Really, this is possibly the best looking IPA I’ve had. It’s looks like a puree of pineapples and oranges, and has a thick, sticky head. The taste is like 32, but a little more bite that I really liked.

I'm a big fan of honey added to IPAs and this really hits the spot. If you've had Buzz from Night Shift, this is that brews bigger sibling with a PhD. Super refined and smooth. Mouthfeel is a smooth medium with a little bit of prickly carbonation, low dryness but a medium- bitter kick at the very end of the sip.

Nose smelled of both tangerine/ sweet orange and honey, but it also had a bready yeastiness, like rising dough, that might have been avoided with some filtration. Mouthfeel was medium, but light for the style. The taste was kind of an oddball admixture of flavors, ranging from earthy, freshly-turned soil to sweet clover honey to rising bread dough to tangerine/sweet orange to a light alcohol heat that tingled my sinus cavity. Phew! It was certainly attention-getting, but it also had a graininess that left my mouth feel like it was coated in powder after each swallow. I CANnot help but wonder what even a modicum of filtration might have done for this beer. Finish was dry, but not overly bitter, more citrusy than anything else.

That white wine flavour which accompanies this hop is the primary hop flavour in the profile, and I've been somewhat put off by this in the past, especially with Brut IPAs, but here it is really well done, leading to a very nice flavour, smooth mouthfeel, and pleasant sweet finish to each sip. Hill Farmstead is off the beaten path, not the greatest to get to, & my god, do they take their damn time getting the line up to move through their brewery.

Revealing beautiful flashes of ruby and garnet when held up to a backlight, and a bouquet that is redolent of coffee, chocolate and coconut, it’s no surprise that one person declared it to be like a “liquefied Mounds Bar.” And that analogy remains relevant on the palate. A smooth mouthfeel and a sweetish finish produce a wonderfully crafted beer. Some have criticized the sweetness level, but I didn’t find it to be excessive. It’s a truly great dessert beer and one that’s on a par with another favorite of mine called Samoa This.

Last Snow,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/31805/75446/,3.24,"The aroma is downright intoxicating when it comes to coconut qualities - this really does smell like a liquefied Mounds bar, Coffee, roasted malt, and (of course) dark chocolate all offer a nice ballast to the coconut. One niggle: The additions are so bold, they overpower the porter backbone somewhat. This beer is a total showstopper on the taste buds...well, at least for the first few sips. Apart from a slightly roasted opening, coconut utterly dominates in the best/worst way around the middle and end. Coffee plays second fiddle to the coconut flavors, just like the aroma indicated. Speaking of how it ends, the finish comes across like this coconut coffee porter had three tons of table sugar clumsily added to it - there\'s that ""so sweet, it\'s somehow bitter"" sensation I get from a select few dessert beers (like Creme Brulee from Southern Tier...or Maple Bacon Coffee Porter from Funky Buddha themselves!) At the end of the day, the actual flavor of this beer is a total letdown next to the awesome nose. Plus, it feels thin and angular - not a good combination with the extreme levels of sweetness. Said extreme sweetness ultimately chokes the drinkability factor. Carbonation is medium high. I do enjoy this more than their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, but eh. I don\'t need to have this again either way.', '3.24/5: Syrupy and absurdly sweet - perfect for the hypetrain crowd!"

The taste made me think it would be boozy, maybe it should have been, but at 6.4% ABV it's almost sessionable.

I can't lie to you this is scrumptious. If you like a sweet stout that does not have lactose added to it then this is up your alley although it is costly, but I don't downgrade beer because of their price. Pretty good porter that almost feels like a full bodied roasty stout. This is a sweet stout all the way with slight roasted malts, this is a beer that I would not session due to the sweetness of the coconut & the edginess of the coffee but it's a great one time, one bottle treat for the evening, but it's definitely not something that I would want to session Cheers!

Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/30356/149331/,4.76,"A beer that lives up to the reputation. I’ll get to the appearance at the end of the review, mostly because the smell and taste are the two most important parts of this beer and for one other reason. Smell is boozy barrel up front with a healthy amount of warm apple to round it out. Taste is more balanced, with the apple slightly leading the way and the boozy oaky barrel subtly surrounding it. Feel is medium bodied, neither oily nor thick-a perfect example of “just right”. Mouth watering, drinks more like a non-barrel aged 9 or 10% abv than a big bold 12.', 'My only problem, however, was evident right off the open and pour. I opened it and got hit with the apple and brandy before the cap came off, but I didn’t hear the usual noise one expects opening a beer, because the one I had had little to no carbonation. It has a nice dark hue with some brown edging, but there was no foam and very little lacing. If they date their beer with the first three numbers being the date, this was bottled 9/26/18. Doing a little online research, in October of last year, there was a release by Prairie that some of this beer was infected, so I don’t know if that’s the case here. But if this beer infected just means the loss of carbonation, I’d take an infected version of it over a lot of other beers out there. Because this is phenomenal! Long time want, glad I got it."

First taste was rewarding that it seemed balanced like the original. Then the big let down came into play. The mouth drenching aftertaste of apple juice plagued my mouth. This is not a barreled apple brandy. If it is it is way over powering of the bomb like base that seems balanced at first. The actual brandy alcohol seems even lost to me from the apple domination. Is this a bad beer? No. Is this the best beer I ever had ? No. I even doubt the 12% abv and would rate lower around 10%. I took no measurements though.

The aroma is nice, smooth bourbon barrel, dark bittersweet chocolate, light coffee roast, a bit of green pepper detracts from the aroma a bit but there is a lingering smokiness as well. The flavors are good, lots of bitter dark chocolate, light coffee roast, rich bourbon and dark grains but as it warms, an unpleasant onion and green pepper flavor appears and is amplified by the smokiness of the beer. The mouthfeel is very good, super full bodied, coating and creamy with a rich and velvety texture and a smooth finish.', ""Verdict: A decent barrel aged coffee stout from Hill Farmstead.

Fairly sweet and boozy overall.\nFeel: Thin to medium mouthfeel.\nOverall: This bottle being four years old maybe past it's prime unfortunately. I can almost imagine the stout being more robust in taste and thicker in mouthfeel. Now that the stout is starting to fall apart the barrel treatment is overpowering and is out of balance."
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/77273/,4.96,"I don\'t normally start by stating the overall impression of the beer, but Damon is quite possibly my platonic ideal of a barrel-aged stout.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThis is definitely a labored metaphor, but remember the first time you tried Everett and realized all other porters are child\'s play compared to Shaun Hill\'s magnum opus ""Robust Porter""? If there were a genre of beer called ""Robust Barrel-aged Imperial Stout"" Damon would definitely fall right into that categorization. Every little complex nuance that captivates fans of dark viscous liquids aged in wooden containers is amplified beyond the wildest of imaginations, while at the same time striking a perfectly harmonious symbiosis.', 'An impossible concoction of charred oak, french vanilla, chocolate fudge, medium-roast coffee, raisins, tobacco, molasses, and jammy figs form the heavenly aromatic range associated with this tributary beer. As the brew warms up, the malt-based features of chocolate and coffee take precedence over the more bourbon-inspired olfactory attributes of the pitch-dark nectar of the gods.', 'I quite possibly use this phrase to the point of cliché, but the nose, as expected, is flawlessly replicated on the palate. Every sip of this obsidian magical concoction screams ""bourbon! coffee! chocolate!"" followed by quiet whispers of ""molasses, dark fruits, light vanilla."" The flavors that bombard the tongue throughout the drinking experience remain remarkably consistent; I drank this over a span of twenty minutes sandwiched in-between pours of a different BA stout from OH and a half-barleywine half-stout half-whatthefuck madness from WA, but the flavors remained steady and uninfluenced by the imposing characteristics of both brews upon revisiting. I almost want to call this the Heady Topper of BBA stouts, given its consistency and ungodly balance of flavors throughout the entire drinking experience.', ""The body is thicc like Mya's thighs. I'm about 97% sure that this beer goes to the gym and squats three plates four to five times a week. The no thigh-gap thickness is accompanied by a velvety creamy initial mouthfeel which oddly feels somewhat cool and refreshing to the touch; I might as well just start stringing together random positive-inspiring adjectives to describe this beer and I'd probably still be in the ball park of what it actually smells/tastes/feels like. Gentle simmering carbonation."

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/77273/,4.87,"Pours an oily black color with a small, dark brown head, which vanishes immediately.', ""The aromas of this are simply amazing - there's a lot going on with licorice, scorched malts, tobacco and dark chocolate. The barrel adds a tremendous depth with dried apples, rock sugar, peppers, dried plum and lots of spicy wood, tickling the nose by developing a boozy warmth."", 'Drinks silk and velvet, full bodied with lots and lots of alcohol soaked layers of rich maltiness.', 'Tastes right from the beginning of burned malts, wild honey, whipped cream as for its awesome mouthfeel, and fudge. Develops a spicy licorice roastiness once the barrel gets noteable, together with cinnamon, toasted nuts and a luscious amount of bitter chocolate. Finishes with molasses, melting chocolate, long lasting tobacco, dried earth and a flowery note from the otherwise still pleasantly spicy barrel.', 'This is like an amped up Bourbon County - not necessarily thicker on the tongue, but even creamier with more roast and bitter chocolate, countered by an even sweeter fudge note, balanced by earth and spices. Awesomly intense and balanced throughout."

Chocolate ganache blends perfectly with appropriately subtle barrel aging, and darker fruits start to emerge only as the beer warms.

There is definitely a good amount of citrus (orange and lemon) and other fruits- cherry and peach at the moment. Good amount of honey and caramel. However, the best aspect of the flavor profile is one I can't really describe adequately. This is an extremely fresh and bright beer. Some pine and resin but not enough to render this a hophead's beer. The pine and resin does have a bit of linger which also shows some matchstick and grapefruit. Some orange and lemon peel. Caramel meets up with a bit of matchstick and makes it tastes a bit burnt. Some mustiness. Armpit and dirty socks.

Certainly not in the same class as Notorious, Heady Topper, or Pliny the Younger at the moment."", ""Mouthfeel- Close to medium bodied with a lot of carbonation and zing.

As I pour I hear the carbonation fizzing and sparkling softly, despite it not being visible within its murky colors. A huge foamy tan head retains for seemingly an eternity.\nAs I await for the head to dissipate, I hold the glass up to my nose. It starts off modestly with aromas of dark bread, spice, prune, plum and a hint of citrus peel.\nThe head has now receded slightly and displays a thick and creamy blanket of film. As I put it in my lips I'm amazed by the smooth and silky feel. The gentle carbonation belies the sound I heard earlier and adds to its soft mouthfeel. I first taste amber malts balanced with spice. The overall palate feels dry and with a light hops touch in the finish. The body feels medium and drinkable.\nAlready, this is a great brew, yet, aromas and flavors continue to open up. Holding it up to my nose I smell cloves and light cocoa. The subtle cocoa sweetness expresses itself in the flavor. Fruity esters of raisins, prunes and plums make their presence felt. The hops bitterness begins to increase in a slow and steady crescendo. The malt flavors open up; light dark caramel and slight roasty quality. I hold up the glass to my nose and smell candi sugar and cherries. The bitterness from the hops continues to increase and leaves an earthy dark linger in the finish.\nAs I get towards the final phase of the drink, the sea foam like lace adorns and sticks to the glass. There is a slight grapefruit peel and flavor of cherries as I gulp down the last few sips.\nA sublime and masterful drink. Probably the best Dubbel I've had to date. The only question that remains is whether it is the equal of Westy 12. Perhaps an unfair comparison considering they are slightly different styles.

Sure, you're paying a 20-25% premium for this variation over the regular, but this tastes, at least, 27.875% better. An absolutely barbaric backbone of the familiar, bone-dry, Drie Fonteinen base of battery acid mixed with guanaco urine (alpaca or vicuna urine would be too sweet and rancid, respectively), and an almost mildly lemon-citric overtone. But, what has always set this brewery apart is the ability to blend additional flavors in to add complexity ... unlike some folks who typically produce sours that consist of one overpowering note *cough* Bruery *cough*.

In terms of flavor, it is so complex and well blended that it truly is tough to describe, and yet the overall presentation is nearly flawless. I quibble a touch with the mouthfeel, although it's by no means poor; rather, it is perhaps the only part of this entire experience that I find less that world class, primarily due to the fizz up front that makes savoring the entire sip difficult, instead of focusing on the back half and aftertaste, which is about all that it allows.

The aroma is pleasant, sweet and rich maple leaps out with chocolate and roasty coffee, dark grains, cream and a nice salinity emerges that evokes bacon. The flavors are good, really coffee forward with a nice roast, moderate acidity but a good richness that plays nicely with toasted dark malts while the maple comes out behind the roasted quality toning down the beer and bringing out some cream flavors while a lingering saltiness washes the palate. The mouthfeel is okay, a thinner medium body that coats well, lively and bubbly texture with a nice soft finish.', 'Verdict: A good adjunct porter from Funky Buddha. The texture is a bit thin relative to the amount of flavor packed into this beer while causes there to be a bit of balance issue.

The aroma is fantastic, it smells like a coffee liquor. It melds sweet maple syrup with black coffee and chocolate syrup, and for whatever reason that\'s taken me for a moment back to my days in the Boy Scouts. It\'s clean and bright and enticing although I haven\'t really found the bacon yet, just a suggestion of it. OK, on to the flavor... more coffee, basic, but good, just like a regular cup of Joe black coffee... more maple syrup as expected, and kind of sweet... chocolate syrup... some vanilla... but I\'m still not finding the bacon. I wasn\'t really expecting bacon, but maybe some apple smoked wood maltiness...? Or am I missing it? I get coffee, maple, toffee, almost burnt but not sugar, vanilla, medium to darker caramel, some background fruitiness, and a bit of ashen roastiness. Is it smoky? I don\'t think so, not really, there is some in the far away background but I wouldn\'t consider it smoky. Still, it\'s good. It\'s nice and rich without being overly so, and sweetish but not too sweet although some of that maple sugar does linger on the palate. It\'s not really a dessert beer though, or is it? It could certainly be used as an ingredient in a dessert but it is rich enough to be a dessert beer on its own? Ahhh, maybe. So, OK, what else?

Bitter orange rind notes are most noticeable. good amount of bitter lingering... more than I expected. Finishes drier than I expected. There is a strong mineral character, an almost metallic tingle which, for me, takes over too much of the flavor. Here i was thinking this was a juicy neipa but Citra commonalities aside, this is a different animal. Im hoping it grows on me but it feels a bit “one note”. Im not blown away. Im maybe not as “citra-centric” as others so I shouldn’t be surprised that im not gaga over this. I see why people like it but... seems like a lot of hype surrounding this beer. My issue is that it starts exactly where it ends, it feels almost stingingly sharp with citrus... like your tongue is being zapped, but there isnt a depth to the experience... or a nuance to the hop profile... Again, one note. I normally really like single hop ipas but i think ive learned that citra does not have what im looking for, at least not when all by itself. All that said, it is excellent beer."

There seems to be a nice beer hidden underneath that monster sour kick, and it's a real shame that you can't really taste it well. Some oak - a bit of a buttery white wine flavor - and apricots come through, but both are well in the background. Mostly lacto sourness, mostly just tastes like neutral acidity. Big pucker. Lots of back of the throat sour, phlegmy feeling in the finish. Fairly light body. As I wrote before, there's a good beer in there, but it's so sour that you lose complexity and depth of flavor."

The nose waves a baseball bat worth of flavors around behind its back and says “I’m going the hit you with this, very soon”. Raisin/cherry fruit tones come to the fore, backed by brandy and vanilla cookies. And of course, the taste does indeed clobber you with huge crescendo of coffee, fruit, booze, char, leather and umami. Fantastic. The mouthfeel, again, is just as it should be. This is a unique beer and very much deserves its high reputation. Speaking from experience, and without any fear of contradiction, I can also report that this beer ages beautifully."

As expected, absolutely no sound when the cap was taken off. Zero carbonation, which immediately seems strange. Pours a gorgeous dark brown. The nose is incredible. Reminds me of a 30 year old English barleywine. Tons of oak, caramel, alcohol-soaked cherries, leather, sweet molasses. This, to me, smells old and delicious. Taste is crazy. Immediately picking up strong nutty flavors. The lack of carbonation conveys a syrupy taste. Picking up lots of dark cherries, blackberries, toffee, burnt wood bitterness, leather, rubber, oak, and maybe a hint of soy sauce. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick - very bold.

There is a light resinous quality to this as well, with a hint of grass and pine. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/lively carbonation. This seems like somewhere inbetween an Old School and West Coast IPA, but in a really good way. Great balance of malts and hops, sweetness and bitterness. Not a hint of booze or bubble gum to this, which is impressive given the 8.5% ABV. This actually drinks surpringly easy."

It's golden hue resembles more a glass of Chardonnay than beer, but the narrow, dense, snow-white head gives it away. What the head lacks in height it more than makes up for in retention, as it never fully dissipates; even when it finally sinks, it coats nearly the entire surface with a thin film of foam.Bubbles of carbonation lackadaisically rise to the surface every now then, but they are sparse."", 'Aroma - The aroma is a blend of fresh-cut grass, lemon peel, nectarines, subtle graininess, and finally a burst of white grapes at the end. It is altogether cohesive and summons and subtle tartness that ties everything together. The fruitiness of it makes it infinitely refreshing to smell, and the acidity coupled with the almost tropical-like fruit blend is nearly flawless in execution. The barrel is integrated seamlessly, with waves of oak, vanilla, and finally the wine itself washing over the other notes without overpowering them.', ""Taste - After my first sip, I was surprised at how acidic Art actually is compared to what I perceived in the aroma; to be fair, in contrast to other beers it isn't overly acidic, but it came across more than I expected. After a few more tries to acclimate, it's easier to swallow. The grape-lemon zest combo is still king and why not, since it is so good? Lemongrass and the grains come next to light the load, before finally the fruits emerge again to carry this to the finish. The tartness kicks the flavors up to a whole new level. The wine is a bit more present here and it contributes a slight booziness that oozes into the other flavors to give them that barrel-kissed feeling. The vanilla falls away here, leaving the oak to drive home the barrel notes."", ""Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is probably the only thing I can fault Art on, in my opinion. I was expecting more carbonation based on the style, but it falls pretty low on spectrum, and a bit more would've made this even better. Otherwise, this is very nice. It is light on the palate and is just dry enough to make it super refreshing."", ""Closing Arguments - As my first foray into Hill Farmstead's barrel-aged program, and really, to the brewery itself (I've never really tried many of their beers even though they are always on my radar ever since I had Ephraim way back in early 2011), I didn't know what to expect with Art. Happily, I can easily proclaim this is near the top, if not the top, of my saison list.

Tartness was definitely the star here but I wouldn’t say the beer was overly tart or sour. It had the perfect amount of balance. Medium to light on body with moderate carbonation. Very dry clean finish to it."

Even some blue cheese Mouthfeel: Fairly light bodied with a high carbonation Finish: Dry and surprisingly bitter, with a lingering acidic lemon tartness. Funky blue cheese is there retronasally.

That said, it was mighty carbonated, creating a pleasant effervescence in the mouth and on the tongue. The extensive aging had mellowed it from distinctly sour to a tickle in the hinges of my jaw, but the tartness was still as puckering as ever.

To quote Monty Python, black as the ace of spades, he was, with slightly brownish/purple thinning edges. Had half a fingertip of quickly dissipating head that left a minimal amount of lacing. Smell is a balanced mixture of bourbon barrel, chocolate, and malt. Well, maybe the barrel is more prevalent than the other two. On taste, however, it’s a lot more balanced between the three, with a little bit of vanilla and a bit of a fruity red wine note in there for good measure. Everything comes together-it’s sweet, roasty, and has a tangy, woodsy burn from the barrel. Feel is maybe where this outstanding beer is most outstanding. It’s big and bold from the barrel, but there’s some subtle silky smoothness from the malt and sweet adjuncts. Mouth watering and a healthy alcohol presence.

Barrel Aged Bomb!,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/30356/139521/,4.34,"Interested and curious to try this again. Because I remember the first time having this (in 2016) noting that it muted the chili peppers and now with the 2017 and 2018 bomb! I have felt like the pepper quality has already been muted. And because it's only 11.2%? The regular is 13% and pirate bomb is 15%? What's the difference here? Let's see. Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out looking like dark chocolate in color and forms a very thin caramel crown that disippated before I even got a picture. The first thing I notice on the smell is a ton of dark fruit. Raisins and plums dance around while introducing you to some barrel notes in the form of a dry oak smell. Very good smell but I'm not getting too much from the nose in the way of the regular bomb! So we'll see what the tastes brings. From the first sip the chocolate kicks through the curtain and steals the floor, while the dark fruit are supporting from behind. As far as the chili peppers, it's about what I expected. You wouldn't even know they're in the beer. I wish the coffee and vanilla were showing up a little more as well, but I do have to say that this is greatly balanced as far as the whiskey and barrel being present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and fudge like. It coats the mouth all the way through while providing a slight and well balanced warming sensation. Overall, this was a very good treat and I'm glad to have another crack at it. But it's pretty much what I remember from the first time. It's very good, but not great. I've had better barrel aged beers and it does bother me that this one covers up all the flavors of the original. Kinda takes the point away to me, I guess. It's a solid treat nonetheless, but give me a regular Bomb! and I'll be good."

A thin tan head fades fairly quickly atop a low level of visible carbonation.', 'S: Really nice on the nose. Whiskey and chilis, chocolate and coffee. Sweet malts mixed with vanilla and oak. Notes of drying tobacco and toffee and Bit-o-Honeys. Awfully good.', 'T: Chocolate, chilis and coffee up front. The whiskey heat comes next, with significant oak and vanilla flavors. Caramel, more vanilla, and cacao nibs. Tobacco and some roasted malts add some bitterness. More chocolate and coffee with mild but definite chili heat in the hang.', 'M: The body is heavy, though not as thick and glass-staining as Hunahpu. Low carbonation sensation but fine for style. Alcohol presence is actually pretty restrained for style, but it remains warming as it goes down.', 'O: This was really, really good. The barrel complimented this beer more than I expected. This all really works well. Nice chili flavor without a ton of heat. Definite barrel presence without overwhelming the multiple adjuncts. Excellent.', 'NOTE: I knocked down my ""Overall"" rating a little. I had a second bottle that I reviewed, forgetting that I had already done so.

There is a pretty strong aroma- the Ancho chiles jump out at me, but chocolate and whiskey are there in the background. The taste is complex: there is a hint of coffee present, but whiskey and chocolate are most prominent, with caramel malt, vanilla, oak notes, and a touch of cinnamon following. The whiskey is extremely well-melded with the rest of the beer, and is present mid-palate through the finish. The chiles are somewhat muted, compared to the standard Bomb!, but provide a nice warming heat at the finish. The beer is full bodied, incredibly smooth the entire way through, and a touch boozy on the finish. Pretty incredible.

Not particularly sweet. Small amounts of vanilla are present, as is a moderate vinegary acidity. As it warms up, the oak and tannins seem to combine with the acidity to give a vinous flavour, like a Syrah; in my mind, it seems to impart a lot of red wine notes into the flavour; I suspect this is due to the combination of the oak tannins and the acidity. Whiskey is there, underneath all of this. No heat, but a subtle char is noticeable towards the end.

Flavour is very similar; chocolate fudge and chocolate covered cherries, oak, vinegar. The cherries aren't as prominent as expected. The flavours pop nicely, with a nice tart 8/10 acidity that is quite sour but not bracingly so. No off flavours. As the beer warms, it brings out a little more of the chocolate and less of the cherries; it evolves quite a bit just like its predecessor did. Delicious. Mouthfeel is noticeably thinner than the original batch, I felt. There is still a fair amount of body, but perhaps I am comparing everything to Maman which I had the same day.

Well, this BA version has really brought me around - it’s a very fine beer indeed. Black as night right to the edges. Wonderful, rich boozy nose, redolent with nutty, dark honey malts, a tangle of complex whiskey notes and almost stinging vanilla extract. The taste really fires on all cylinders, with the subtle, elegant power of a Maserati. The super charged whiskey is amazingly well balanced by a super strong malt backbone that ranges from honey through black molasses to traces of charcoal, dry bitter chocolate and just a hint of dried cherries.

Mother Of All Storms,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1304/46230/,4.75,"Got some 2017 bottles from the brewery. So far as I can tell, they haven't distributed this this year. At least not so far."", 'This is really great, BTW.', 'As I was excited to try it, and the bottles were somewhat cool when I got them home, I opened a bottle right away, and poured some into a small Teku. It was probably 10 degrees too warm, so I kept the bottle in the fridge and poured a little every 15 minutes as it cooled down.', 'So, I tasted this in reverse of the usual manner, starting as it was too warm, and sipping it along the way as it cooled down to the 38F fridge temp (instead of starting at 38F and sipping along to way to 60F). Every sip seemed to be an improvement, down to 45F or so. At the cooler temps, the dreamy bourbon flavors become more prominent.', 'Did I mention this was really good? The 1 year of aging in bourbon barrels has paid off with a pronounced, almost forward, bourbon flavor; that is nicely balanced with a slightly hopped sweet maltiness. I was surprised by the strong sweet malt flavors, as this is a BW (though an English BW, which has more malt). Had I tasted this blind, I would have guessed ""bourbon IS"". A very rich and complex concoction. ABV is pretty high, but it is well back of other flavors. It is complex, though not as complex as some things, but the rich bourbon and malt flavors more than make-up for that. You can make a world-class beer without 100 ingredients if you can age it in nice barrels for a year. Adding adjuncts wouldn\'t necessarily be an improvement if it detracted from the pure smooth flavors here. Perhaps this is a high-end beer for the common man. Please don\'t change anything.', 'I had about a half glass of the bottle left after I reached my limit for the day, which I kept in the fridge overnight uncovered. Upon trying this remainder the next evening, I thought it had improved. This surprised me. The bourbon-forward flavor really grabbed me immediately in a way the freshly opened bottle had not. As this required more investigation, I opened another refrigerated bottle (which I had originally planned to age for a year) to compare. The day-old opened beer was better. The only thing I can think of is the effect of losing the carbonation. This beer has little carbonation to begin with, with scarcely any head. The glass that had sat for a day had none whatsoever. Losing the carbonation allowed the malt and bourbon flavors to become more evident. Not only is the carbonation not needed in a beer like this, it is a distraction.', 'Oh yeah, I really like the new label design, too!"

Ghost In The Machine,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/24822/113403/,4.13,"My rating averages the experience between fresh bottles and bottles that have aged a bit. There is a big difference between fresh bottles, and bottles that may have been stored appropriately (refrigerated) for six months. Fresh bottles are excellent, and would fall into my 4.5 range. Older bottles tend to throw a lot of sediment, and the flavor changes significantly for the worse. I'm drinking a bottle MANIFESTED ON 07/30/18, and I've got some major chunks at the bottom of my Nuit Belge Twenty Nineteen glass from New Orleans. I bought some more Ghost In The Machine in New Orleans that was MANIFESTED ON 02/26/19, and it is very good, just like my older batches were when they were (at most) four or five months old. I don't have enough experience to say when sedimentation begins, or when the flavor turns for the worse. But because this is a recurring theme, I'll caution you to drink when new and fresh nd enjoy.

As its rich and sultry darkness settles into the snifter, its milkshake comparisons are obvious. Black as night and rounding with a creamy tan lather, the beer's robust fragrance swirls around coconut and chocolate with hints of pepper, oak and margarita lurking in the recesses of scent. Lavishly rich, dense and robust in taste, its dark chocolates, espresso and nutty flavors settle on the tongue like brownie batter."", ""As the stout saturates the tastebuds, its sweetness holds on through the duration of the session and continues to balance the brunt of alcohol and chili spice. Sugary like chocolate cake, the beer's taste of heavy cream, vanilla and barrel caramel takes off the rougher edges of roast and has the beer feeling just as silky and malted milkshakes. Bourbon offers a bold coconut, char, vanilla, caramel and nutty taste that garners more attention nearing the finish."", ""Obviously thick, chewy and pleasantly cloying, the beer is designed as a long, savory, slow sipping affair while its chocolates, sweetness and viscosity won't so much pair with dessert, but rather replace dessert altogether."

Not only do we have the traditional Mexican chocolate treatment, but there's tequila barrels and lactose sugar thrown in as well. I was worried at first when this bottle gushed a little and looked weird in the glass. There were just a few large bubbles on the surface of the beer popping aggressively until they left without a trace. It also takes a minute for the aroma to develop, but when it does the boozy exterior gives way to inviting notes of cinnamon and dark fruit. Those dark fruits are a welcomed feature of this beer adding complexity on the aroma and taste. I think they're able to come through because the chocolate is not as forward as some other stouts in this style. I get some milk sugar and lots of vanilla in the flavor, but the texture isn't as creamy as you'd expect from a milk stout. The tequila provides a burn going down. When combined with the heat from the peppers and the spritzy carbonation, this beer seemed slightly off balance in stark contrast wit hthe other BL beer I've tried, Ground State. The mouth feel is adequate, but nothing special. The highlight of this beer is the excellent flavors of cinnamon, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, dark fruits, and the unique blend of tequila that makes this beer a little bit different from the traditional beer in this style."

Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/216/74778/,4.45,"#1,000 for reals this time. I’ve been squirrelling so much anticipation, ewe wouldn’t even believe, but bear with me - this is a massive milestone, let me crow about it [animal puns: success!]. 7 years ago I posted my first review on beeradvocate.com, and in that time I’ve had many many great beers, and in the last few years less and less crap beers. TBH I realised life is short there are too many beers out there for one man to drink (and review) so I’ve been sticking with the “good stuff”. Rodenbach Caractère Rouge: good stuff I’ve heard, plus I already love Rodenbach Grand Cru, seems like a no brainer. No, it isn’t my usual “what’s the BIGGEST (ABV) beer I can get my hands on”, but let’s give something different a go (yo!).', 'Poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.', 'A: Cloudy red fruit coloured body with a nice tight-packed salmon-tinged head that slowly dies back to a thin lace ring. A stunning seductress: “the coyote of the desert likes to eat the heart of the young and the blood drips down to his children for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and only the ribs will be broken...” mmm. 9/10.', 'S: Red currents, cherry, grape-aid, hints of vanilla, the aroma is quite sweet, very fruity, but this no doubt belies a tart flavour hiding within the flavour profile. Without question this is the most berry fruit I’ve ever encountered in a beer - it’s a pervading musk, like a female version of Sex Panther: “60% of the time, it works every time” [yes, it’s a Ron Burgundy night for me]. 9/10.', 'T: God damn this is a taste sensation. It’s upfront sugar: red current, cherry, raspberry, cranberry, grape-aid, hints of vanilla, then in comes that classic Flanders Red Ale sharp acidic tart overtone to cut through all sweetness and finish crisp and moreish. It comes with an acid reflux trigger warning: you will get reflux from this if you’re susceptible. Further sips make me question the amount of tartness in this brew - such a complex and beautiful homage to berry fruits, yet it’s a touch too sour IMO. Otherwise it’s a grand flavour profile. 9/10.', 'M: Medium bodied, hints of wateriness, with a heavy/dense carbonation. 8/10.', 'D: Sourness holds Caractère Rouge from being up there with Grand Cru, however we’re comparing a world class Fruit Beer with a world class Flanders Red Ale... made by the same brewer! Rodenbach are legends, for good reason, they make unique beers, and what might be too sour and acidic for me might be perfect for you, horses: courses. It’s all glorious, viva beer! 9/10.', 'Food match: Game meats with wild forest mushrooms and truffle (oh & an antacid)."

I guess that secondary fermentation in the bottle just didn't happen. It's a cloudy, almost brown color with just a thin collar of white. The aroma is fruity with notes of raspberry and cherry, and a little bit of Graham Cracker, and that carries over into the flavor. There's some oak as well but it's limited, at least in comparison to the fruit, and there's a touch of golden to medium caramel and a subtle note of chocolate as well. It's not tart but there's a light acidity to it, giving it a slightly metallic edge, and the softer carbonation works really well - perhaps it's intended to be like that. The very fine bubbles gently bristle the tongue, and the acidity lends it a hand, but at the same time it remains very soft and easy to drink. I'm a little bit torn in that it's not more intense, but at the same time so refined and sophisticated that it's hard to argue against. It's obviously a world classic, the question is where does it fall in the line-up. Well worth seeking out."

Smell takes on more of the flavors from the original: cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, hot peppers, cake breadiness, black strap molasses, slight dark fruit and smoke, plus then the bourbon and wood from the barrel, maple is there but faint. Not as pure smelling as original, but heavier. Taste is incredible, so much complexity, take all of those aromas from the smell, add smoky maple, caramel, and rich malt work.

It's more aggressive on the nose. But also more aggressive is the lactic acidity, which is a bit surprising as typically it is the Side Project that tends to have a reputation for being more acidic. A bit of cheese, fair bit of oak, mild dusty funk, but the nose is driven by peaches, and there are peaches for days! Flavour is a bit more skewed in favor of the acidity. Heavy lactic acidity with a touch of lemon seems to be the main theme here. Same big peach flavour, but it is slightly overshadowed. Dusty funk, oak rounds things out. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, but as said before, it is pretty heavy on the lactic acidity. I don't mind it certainly, but I am wishing it was dialed back a bit so I could get even more of the peach on the background of oak and dust.

Coffee Abraxas,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/25888/101578/,4.34,"Pours black and after a very moderate intensity pour, nets near zero head. What head is there comes via a ring of khaki foam that lingers a long while. Aroma is huge, hitting all the notes of the base beer - cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, chilies and other spices. Dark chocolate and cocoa powder add a little dry sweetness. Medium-bodied, dark coffee is interwoven throughout the structure of the nose, never taking the limelight, instead subtly reminding the palate it\'s there. Roasty, toasty malts add firm and dark support, but are an afterthought to the additive flavors. Flavor profile is deep notes of mingling cardamon, nutmeg, ancho (mild) chilies and cinnamon with medium-bodied, dark coffee, and roasty malts up front. Medium-bodied coffee hits center stage for a brief glimpse between spices and malts, and then returns to lingering and observing from aside the curtain. While spices eagerly welcome each sip like a used car salesman do for a visitor to the lot, they quickly fade to show the frame work of this beer - roasty, toasty, nutty malts - in other words, robust and dark. Between the dynamics of spices, coffee, and malts, there are flashes of chocolate, cocoa powder, and molasses. Very dynamic despite a slightly heavy hand on the spices. Perhaps more so than any other beer I\'ve had, serving temperature is critical here. Too cold and the spices come off heavy, but as the beer warms a touch, the spices meld into the dark malt backdrop, forming a sublime experience. As this beer nears the 50F mark, it develops a sublime balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a smooth, creamy texture that develops a fairly still texture when served directly out of the fridge. As the beer warms, it develops a more grainy, velvety texture, enhancing the experience. Overall, the headline here is ""ABRAXAS"", with the subtitle being ""enters a non-mutually exclusive relationship with coffee"". Coffee is present, particularly as the beer warms, but never steps into the limelight for more than a brief second or two.

I began by unhooking the cage & exposing the cork, all while keeping my L thumb on the cork. It was a wasted effort as the cork was an immovable object! Grrr. 8={} Where\'s my corkscrew?!? F**k! Since I am not an oenophile like my beloved maternal uncle, I only have a cheapie in my inventory. The cork fought me mightily, but in the end, I was triumphant! Eureka! Success in the face of adversity! Onward! I slowly filled one of my St. Petersburg glasses, being careful not to disturb any lees on the punt. It came up pretty quickly with foam, forming two-plus fingers of fizzy, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head that quickly reduced to wisps. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. Khrushchev nodded in agreement, having kept the Nazis from penetrating at the Battle of Stalingrad. The nose penetrated my sinuses & gave me pause. What had I gotten myself into? Was I going to be like Lee Harvey Oswald - a person interested in Russian lore & literature, only to be rebuffed by the Russians? Eek. It had the distinctive coconut odor that I associate with Bourbon Bbl.-aging. Its booziness was not overwhelming, but it was like sniffing the air of a shark tank from above. All seemed calm & peaceful from that vantage point, but danger lurked below & in my glass. Mouthfeel was thick & full, very viscous. It lay upon my tongue like a beached whale, refusing to move or to be moved. No problem as I took in its liquified fudge brownie taste. Highly chocolaty in a deep, dark, Baker\'s chocolate way with a smoky charcoal aspect & the Bourbon really beginning to kick in. I remember the first time that I sipped Bourbon. I was quite young & an adult slipped me some at a NYE party at my parents\' house. This beer evoked that memory. It is not that I do not like Bourbon, but I prefer Rye. In fact, where I had eschewed liquor for many, many years thanks to repeated liberty incidents, it was the resurgence of Rye whisky that brought me back to the fold. I am older & (hopefully) wiser now so my imbibing in distilled liquor is done in small amounts. While typing that last bit, I found myself absentmindedly licking & smacking my lips. It was just THAT tasty! Yum! Stone recommends storing at Cellar Temps, but I would encourage drinking it at Room Temp. It was really blossoming & opening up as it warmed. The flavors were bonding more than they had been at the outset so that it no longer seemed quite as boozy & it did seem more chocolaty as a result. The coconut & charcoal smokiness remained a constant throughout. Phew. Anise! How did I miss it? This is why I always transcribe information! Of course. I would almost say ""treacle"", but that would be imprecise. Anise. That also helps to account for that charcoal sharpness that I had noted. Now, a question - Too late for me, but how would/will this age? I have a feeling that it would really smooth out to become eminently drinkable. It is quite the drink now, in its youth, but as it ages, I think that it has real potential. Finish was dry, quite bitter in the way that black coffee & Baker\'s chocolate are bitter. I was duly impressed throughout."

Served in a stemmed glass.', ""Pours a light straw yellow body, one finger white head with good retention; medium collar with no lacing. Smells of mostly the base sour blonde, with lactic acid, a bit of grainy cereal sweetness, faint strawberry fruit sweetness. I couldn't find the kiwi there, but I think the acetic aspects of it is interspersing in with the lactic acid on the aroma. Flavour brings out a little bit more of the strawberry, which is subtle still. It's there, kind of like a acetic strawberry flavoured yogurt with a small drizzle of lemon and oak; then the strawberry fades and there is a moderate acetic and lactic acidic kick that finish things off. It's interesting, and it kinda works. It's certainly different. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, somewhat creamy, fades a bit on the finish as the sour fades, leaving not a whole lot to ponder. It's a relatively simple beer that I believe accomplishes the intent of the brewer, which is to integrate strawberry and kiwi in a sour blonde without trying to blow peoples' palates away."
Kiwi Herman,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3120/153559/,4.88,"This is one of the rare beers that I will say is worth the hype. This is in my top 5 sour beers. The nose start with a 50/50 blend of sweet and sour. The sour is acidic, citrus, and farmhouse. The sweet is strawberry, caramel, and tropical fruit. The flavor matches but brings the beer to the next level. The balance and flavor is nearly unparalleled. There is the sour and tart from the microflora that is the best of any sour out there. The sweetness from the fruits is there. The strawberry is more dominate then the kiwi but both are present. Well done Alpine, I hope they bring this beer back."

Smell is rich bourbon and chocolate fudge; the bourbon is a smooth and slightly warming presence, oak and charred caramel. Milk chocolate, touch of cinnamon, and touch of cocoa rounds it out. It's a very smooth, well-integrated bourbon barrel on the aroma working with the base beer. Flavour is a bit muddled, however. I get a bit of milk chocolate and a touch of cinnamon up front, with a more astringent and bitter cocoa. Hunahpu's has never been a super cinnamon forward beer, and it shows here. There is mostly milk chocolate, cocoa, and a fair bit of whiskey flavour and heat. A bit of vanillin perhaps thickens up the mouthfeel on the backend some. I do notice a fair bit of extra heat on the backend, that lingers for a little bit after you've finished your sip, a bit of a sting to it. Pretty solid, and the balance is what I remember the base beer to have, except the bourbon adds on an additional dimension.

Sheets of fine, reticulated lacing adorn the glass as the beer recedes."", ""As for the taste? I'm in flavor country... The juxtaposition of fresh-roasted coffee and bountiful sweetness is not only interesting, but substantial enough to mask its massive ABV. The coffee is not at all bitter or acrid, while the aforementioned sweetness is equal parts brown sugar and creme brulee. Warming reveals fruitier tones of black currants, dates, and figs, while rumors of alcohol finally manifest deep into the finish. The bourbon barrel is conspicuously understated, so much so that I nearly forgot this is a barrel-aged beer. That said, the extra layer or flavor is hardly necessary with everything else going on. Medium body and fine carbonation make for a smooth, fluffy mouthfeel that once more belies this beer's epic girth."", ""Honestly, I would be hard-pressed not to rank this among the top 4-5 imperial stouts I've ever had.

Flora,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/62290/,4.51,"750ml bottle, Batch #6, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 7.4.15, reviewed from Tasting Journal.', '\nThe beer pours a nice golden apricot color, lemon hues, hazy and cloudy with a large, billowy and soapy white head, about 3 fingers high that has fantastic retention and lace. The aroma is wonderful, tart wheat, oaky acidic wine character, loads of wildflower, mineral water, citrus fruits, and light berry esters. The flavors are great, wheaty and doughy malt, tartness right up front, lightly citrusy, rustic wildflower, saison yeast, wine barrel that is both earthy and acidic, chewy oak sweetness and hearty mineral water. Loads going on, plenty of nice saison base that plays really, really well with the wine character. The mouthfeel is quite nice, coating, super smooth, gentle carbonation, creamy, delicate, delightful tart finish.', ""Verdict: Another fantastic saison from Hill Farmstead and yet another example of Shaun's prowess with utilizing wine barrels. Plenty of complexity, brightness, nice tartness, very delicate, so refreshing and easy to drink."
Flora,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/62290/,4.47,"A very lovely saison. It has the nice tartness that is characteristic of HF saisons, leaving a bit of a pucker but not in a dominating way. Flavour contains grape, oak, lemon and peach, with a slightly dry finish, with the oak really coming out. The mouthfeel is also terrific - nice and lively without being irritating, a softness that makes it very pleasant to drink. Hard to be too complimentary of this beer - it is a terrific example of a saison, with the yeast playing a very large role and light fruit flavours dancing about. The barrel treatment is also well done - it is notably better than Florence, which is already a very good beer. A pricy bottle but certainly worth it - I would have bought more if they let me!"

Full-bodied, dry mouth entry, almost scrubbing in feel, the carbonation active with more prickle than creaminess. The breadiness more toasty and here the tarriness sinks in deeper. White pepper and a light salinity take the sappy goodness out of the pine notes. Somehow the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus gets pushed back to past the mid-palate, the carbonation churns it away.

In that regard--and in others--it compares well with the legendary Heady Topper. Big, three fingered head, incredible nose loaded with citrus and pine and dangerously drinkable at 8.2%, this is an outstanding example of the now-revered NEIPA style. (It also helps to explain why that style is now-revered and wildly popular.)\nOn the front end, the beer has a pleasant bready character; in the middle, the citrus fruit (tangerine, orange) makes its presence known, along with some pear and pine notes.

Lots of bright stone fruit, peach, wheat, and white grape could be found in the varied nose as the taste had quite a range of flavors to it as well. Light wood, citrus pith, and a subtle earthiness could be found on the palate as this warmed up as I enjoyed the nuances of this beer. Moderately slick and lightly carbonated, this felt like Hawaiian Punch in the aftertaste as the tropical and juicy notes lingered on my tongue once the liquid fully went down...', ""Not a lot of booze to this as this truly was an American Pale Ale and not an IPA that went by another name. Balanced in body, there was little sediment in the liquid or at the bottom of my pint glass once I finished this off. Certainly enjoyable, this wasn't a standout beer but had enough going for it that the hype wasn't entirely unjustified. Fans of Trillium would be wise to see this out although it's certainly not a hop bomb or full of dankness.

Smells of tart lactic acidity, blackberry puree. Mild grainy malt sweetness in the background, but make no mistake, the acidity and the blackberry are the stars here. Although, the blackberry is certainly playing second fiddle to the lacto and acetic acid. Flavour is surprisingly less sour than expected, e.g. La Fosse, and the blackberries kick in towards the end. For the most part, it's oak, a bit of hay, a lot of lactic and acetic acid contributing a strong sense of sourness. The blackberries start to come into their own halfway in, and leave you with a mild jammy flavour at the end. The tartness never recedes but is rather constant. Still, it's a tasty beer and is far easier to drink than La Fosse. Overall, a very nice blackberry wild, but it lacks a good bit of complexity for the most part.

Pours dense pitch black color with a minimal spotty lace cap. Minimal lacing with some clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Lightly increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Very mild herbal/roast/char bitterness and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, dark bread, coconut, licorice, dark fruit, light smoke/char/pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and slightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is amazing. Mildly increasing warmth of 13.5%, with no barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV; with the very mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Insanely rich malt complexity, with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy/tannic on barrels. A highly amazing offering, and top tier style example as expected."

I was skeptical of the hype and didn't want to be disappointed. I've been hurt too many times in the past!"", ""I made the mistake of giving this one a shot when it was still too cold.

The coffee forms in the mid-taste, filling out the body a bit and leading to that chocolate brownie like impression overall. In my original notes, I had a light tang and dryness from the barrel grabbing the edges by the end. In this sitting, I am getting some of the dryness, but not so much the barrel. Instead I am getting a light oily nutty aspect. Overall, though, it is still a dark chocolate cocoa impression. What I do get, with warmth, is the coffee making subtle inroads into the chocolate taste.', 'I really enjoyed this beer, as you got a little bit of all the expected notes playing together. The bourbon seems to lead to a more chocolatey flavor. However, the coffee was well integrated, and adds a richness and darkness to the chocolate. I almost miss the coffee as I indulge in the richness of the beer, though it is not hiding all that hard."

Nelson,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3120/32286/,4.37,"Straight pour from a pry-off 12oz bottle to a flared pilsner glass—AZ Wilderness’ Wilderpils glass. This has a bottling date of … who knows. “8254 1 0812,” whatever that means. All I know is that I bought the first sixer I saw in a store, and it’s a very recent release—past couple of weeks.', 'Appearance (4.0): Two fingers of bone white, fluffy foam rise off of the pour, capping a modestly hazy, glowing yellow-golden body. The head dies down slowly, leaving a pock-marked cap and concentric collars of delicate lacing linked to the beer with light, tight, lacy webs. The lacing doesn’t stick around forever, but the overall impression is quite pretty while it’s there.', 'Smell (4.5): Navel orange zest and alphonso mango flesh mix with lightly peppery, spicy rye that shakes off a bit of dusty straw as it wafts into your nostrils. Bright, grassy notes, underripe pineapple, and passionfruit rind mix together to make a slightly bracing, refreshing tropical mélange that’s never sweet and cloying (as much as I love those sweet, juicy aromas of some contemporary (D)IPAs). As it opens up, oodles of passionfruit and gooseberry come out. Classic Nelson Sauvin, boosted by the spicy earth of rye, which adds a nice depth off of which the hops can play out in their full expression.', 'Taste (4.5): In spite of the haze, this beer is all West Coast (which should be obvious, given this beer long predates the haze craze). The hops roll in clean and bitter, offering a nice grapefruit zest bite, quickly punctuated by earthy, peppery rye and a bit of that dusty straw character noted in the nose. In turn, that straw note rolls into wads of grass and a weedy, dank feel that underlies the bitter, lingering finish that weirdly turns into a nice, subtly sweet citrus note. Going back to the midpalate, passionfruit stays on the downlow, staying subtle and adding depth and color to everything else going on, but leaving a nice, funky tropical character that echoes across everything else. Meanwhile, gooseberry comes out in full tartness. It’s beautiful. No sign of booze.', 'Mouthfeel (4.0): Dry, medium weight but far from full-feeling, the body comes in atop a layer of medium-grain, somewhat prickly carbonation that foams up in a classically effervescent kind of way, not soft and velvety but not aggressive and champagne-like, either. It maintains a steady dryness throughout, before fizzling away with a not-quite-starchy, even dryer finish. This drinks like a West Coast IPA.', 'Overall (4.25): I like this beer. I like it a lot. It’s a West Coast IPA through and through, in spite of the rye and the haze. It’s actually a nice little case study in substyles, for that reason, and the end result is delightful. I’ve been wanting to try fresh Nelson for years, and I finally got to. This, to me, is a must-try. It’s maybe not the absolute best or most memorable West Coast (D)IPA I’ve ever had, but it’s also so well executed that its merits are unimpeachable. Like, it’s as solid as this substyle gets, and its individual components are outstanding: a nice showcase for Nelson with excellent brewing execution and a perfect use of rye. Very highly recommended. I’m going to enjoy the shit out of the rest of this sixer."

Tested the 1st bottle slightly chilled, IMO, it's still Nelson, but a little dumbed down in the 12oz bottle. The Nelson that was produced in Alpine before the sale to Green Flash, had so much Nelson hop aroma in the head it would almost trigger a gag reflex, and was unmistakeable for any IPA's that that had Nelson in the recipe. Still overall it's Nelson, and consumed the next 2 bottles chilled and poured into a Riedel 32oz burgundy stem, the look was spot on as in the 1st bottle as was the mouth feel, the smell and taste was evident that they did not use enough Nelson hops. However, at $12.99 a 6pack I think it's tasting better. Lately it's been showing up on tap in LA and the OC, it's always better on tap but get it while you can, however you can.

The hop herbal flavors reveal themselves over the taste, which is what I hope for in a big IPA. Great alpha oil finish with resinous pine and citrus rind. The malt thins out a little in the finish, but there is still a fine, lingering hop bitterness. I hope this stays in our market; with all the local breweries emphasizing hazies and bruts, I will take my classic IPA fix from any source and this is a promising one."

I picked up a can of this, my first ever Surly offering (though I had the Amagher/Surly collaborative version of this at Lord Hobo for Zwanze Day like five years ago or so, if I recall correctly), at my local Craft Beer Cellar just yesterday afternoon, which I found weird. Maybe that means we'll get more Surly soon. I've kinda always wanted to have a glass of Furious, so I hope that happens."", ""Anyway, this is a Citra/Mosaic DDH IPA that borders on (but doesn't quite become) a double IPA, and it has a lot to live up to based on those reviews down below mine. Pours a deep golden color, almost like a medium-amber honestly. Remember IPAs looking like this? Yeah, I know, I barely do either. The head is decently foamy, measuring about two-fingers of slightly-off-white suds that lace pretty nicely. Good legs and structure to the head here, for sure, and I can see a lot of carbonation rising from the bottom of my glass, which is always a good sign. I think this is a tad darker in color than the current trends, but the recipe is very 2014, so kudos to them for sticking to their guns."", ""Even though this was only canned 5 weeks ago (just hit my distribution area, so it's not like I've been sitting on this review or whatever), it smells kind of... old? Sure, there are the requisite tangerine, papaya, pine resin, and grassy notes that every decent Citra/Mosaic IPA should boast, but it just doesn't have a lot of vivacity to it. Some light tannins and crisp biscuity malt come out too... almost has an English IPA bent to it for whatever reason?"", 'The flavor profile is, once again, a bit malty and stiff, though with some good grassiness and citrus pith. However, it just feels kinda stale and been-there-done-that. There\'s no excitement to be had here! This was great when I had it on that Zwanze Day when it was a new beer, as I recall, but this doesn\'t do much for me nowadays. Feel is pretty good; medium-bodied and well-carbonated with a nice biting bitterness toward the finish and a smooth, massaging mid-palate. Anyway, I don\'t know if it\'s the recipe that\'s changed, or if this really falls off after only a few weeks, or what, but... yeah, I\'m not loving it. Definitely not the top ""American IPA,"" and it would honestly be nowhere near my top 100 if I bothered to assemble such an exhaustive list."

There's a distinct dark chocolate note, some dark caramel syrup, and a little bit of oak. It's pretty intense and I can only imagine that it'll open up as it warms. This is one of those beers that you can almost enjoy just by sitting and smelling it - of course no one would have the will power to do that. OK, on to the flavor... it's just as intense if not more, and there are additional notes of dark fruit, hot chocolate/cocoa, molasses, and coffee to it. Everything previously noted still comes through, and the Bourbon and oak are in just the right place; sometimes there can be too much or too little. It doesn't seem that bitter and yet it's surprisingly well balanced. The alcohol helps, but it doesn't come too far forward, well, any further than you'd expect for 13.4%. Ahh, and there's that note of coconut I always find in Bourbon barrel beers. Interesting. I'd say that this is one of the best Imperial stouts on earth except that the Bourbon barrel aging almost makes it something completely different. It's impressive.

Is a beer that you can drink it with your friends outside and not you can drink it alone in your house i guess.. Little spicy and little bitter for my taste but i enjoy it despite i prefer more the ""Franziskaner hefe"" on that style.."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/252/731/,4.5,"Tried this beer at the brewery and it was great. Cloudy, full bodied, fruity aroma. Everything you want in a wheat beer. This is my wheat beer benchmark."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/252/731/,4.24,"Exceptionally warm, easy to drink beer. Full bodied, full flavored, yet subtle enough to crush. The malts are toasty and sweet, the yeast is sharp but not sour, and the wheaty balance is exceptional. Don't waste time drinking trendy American hefes, always go German first."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/252/731/,4.45,"Bottle pour to tall glass. Huge, dense, white head with good retention, hazy yellow color, minimal lacing. Nose of banana, yeasty. Taste is bright, wheat, bread, banana, clove. Finish is crisp. Body and carbonation are above average."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/252/731/,4.73,"I tried one of these on a whim while hosting a cheese and charcuterie party, figuring it'd go well with an intense three-year-old Gouda I was gifted. All I can say is WOW."", 'I\'ve never been a fan of wheat beers (Canadian and American ones, anyway), but I think I ""get"" them now. Perfect balance of crispness, flavour, and visual appeal (that head, though!). Only critique for me is that the boozy nose is a bit misleading to how smooth and sweet the beer is. A new instant ""go-to"" for me, and I can\'t wait to get to know Bayerische beers better."

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/252/731/,3.61,"It was the first one served in a tasting of international beers, and it is said is one of the best of its kind, so I was pretty eager to try it. I was uninpressed by it. A good beer overall, but I expected more of it.', 'We tasted it in the proper glass, and it was served around 7ºC, so optimal conditions. We let it rest a couple of minutes before drinking it and it developed about 2cm of a thick white head/collar.', 'Charged with cereal aroma, it was too alcoholic on nose for me.', 'On mouth though, things started to improve: overall good, with cereal taste clearly distinguished within it.

There's the faintest suggestion of orange rind and some mulling spice tucked in as well."", ""Palate: First sip brings that creamy grainy wheat flavour, with surprisingly little sweetness. The fruity yeast esters follow, with more bubblegum, faint clove, green banana, apple, faint clove, and some German hop florals. It's very clean, crisp, and tame. There's a subtle spicy kick before the finish, which brings more bubblegum, wheat grain, German hop notes, lots of clove, and a very toned -down bitterness compared to American hefewiezens."", 'Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is fairly light in body - crisp - with a noticeable softness to the feel. The soft wheat coats yhe tongue, and gives some nice texture. Effervescence is lively, but not aggressive or prickly. Everything feels appropriate for the style.', ""Overall: Hefeweizens are not a favourite style of mine. Nevertheless, I try to look at everything as objectively as I can. This is probably the most enjoyable hefeweizen I've had this far. It feela incredibly refined and complete, with no rough edges or off flavours. Unlike many American offerings, it isn't over-hopped or spiced in any way. It isn't a complex beer whatsoever. It isn't wildly unique or groundbreaking. It's a very classic style, after all. It is, on the other hand, a really great example of beer in its most simple, classic, original form. A true German offering. It may not br a glass to dive in and study, but it sure hits the spot when you want a cold beer, and this will certainly pair very nicely with many dishes."

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/252/731/,4.6,"It being in the low 90\'s at the PONDerosa, today and just back from a stint at the pool, The PubScout decided to take a break from his usual IPA summer slakers and go back in time--like 1200+ years. Weihanstephaner Staatsbrauerei had hops growing near its monastery in 768 AD. And seeing a lonely bottle of this classic wheat beer in the back of my fridge, I decided to try to resurrect the reactions I had when first I tasted this incredible beer decades--not centuries--ago, no matter what Paul Z. says.\nI was first impressed back then by the banana-clove-bubblegum notes so very evident in the nose and on the palate. A crisp spiciness could also be detected with a bit of concentration, as well.\nGreat news! This is still the same wonderful wheat (at least 50%) beer that rocked my beer world back when hazy, juicy IPA\'s were not even on the radar.\nAnd, with the temps soaring today, it was the perfect beer--smooth, medium mouthfeel, no bitter hop dominance and just a most refreshing, extraordinarily drinkable beer. Its low ABV (5.4%) makes it most sessionable, and I\'d imagine it would pair well with anything except game meats and chocolate desserts.\nIf those Juicy Haze-bombs ever run their course (and they likely will), millennials and everyone else might benefit by going ""Back to the Future,"" and discovering what a classic, refreshing summer beer is supposed to taste like. Everything old may well be new again."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/252/731/,4.87,"This was possibly the best beer I have ever had. I had two full Maßkrugs of this beer at the German American Cultural Society of Rhode Island's Sommerfest event. It was on tap, and was just perfect. It had a cloudy amber look to it and a clean, fresh, refreshing flavor. I HIGHLY recommend this beer."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/252/731/,3.84,"Ooo. Expanding my horizons here. I’ve tried a good few hefe’s Of the American variety so was happy to find this highly rated Bavarian style, from the world’s oldest brewery no less (they must be doing something right by now!). Look and smell were enjoyable but the taste is heavy - almost oily, this lends itself to a nice full mouthfeel, but I prefer brighter/cleaner/crisper to date."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/252/731/,5,"My review from the beer on the grounds IN FREISING. Maybe at some point when the IPA fad dies down the Germans will start shipping in CANS and shipping with expeditiousness. This is the definition of summer beer. No orange required.\nYou alter the reinheitsgebot for a beer-this one-you know something is right.\nIf you can find a GUTMANN von TITTING, it's the only one that beats this."

Enjoyed out of a green 375 mL bottle but I was not able to catch the bottling date (if there was one). Poured into a small Belgian-style tulip glass.', ""Appearance (4.5) - Pours a hazy golden color that reminds me of the color of an egg yolk, but with more notes of orange and amber going on than what you'd expect. The head is about a finger at most and a fairly stark/snow white in color. It doesn't last long before fading to a ringlet around the edges of the glass and just a faint swirl of foam across the surface of the liquid."", ""Smell (4.5) - There are a few key elements present which all combine quite nicely. Of course, there is a fantastic lactic acidity that makes my tastebuds pucker slightly in anticipation before ever taking a sip. But alongside that, the vinous characteristics of white wine and oak, with even perhaps a hint of vanilla. And finally, there is a subtle hint of white grape tartness that is different in nature from the bacteria-based sourness that is clearly present. It adds a depth to the sourness that might not be there without the fruit. I can't wait to dive into this and drink it."", 'Taste (4.75) - The flavor does not disappoint, with all of the elements that presented themselves in the aroma pushing through in equal parts. Woody, musty oak and lactic sourness leads the way, inducing a nice satisfying pucker and refreshing tartness. As with the smell, the inclusion of the wine grapes gives a bit of juicy sourness that balances nicely alongside some funky, yogurt-like characteristic. The finish is where the chardonnay comes through, with crisp granny smith apple and white grape lingering on the palate.', 'Mouthfeel (4.5) - Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated, with a lingering dry finish that entices the next sip.', ""Overall (4.5), a fabulous beer, and my first in the Biere Brut style, although I can't imagine that this take could be considered typical. It's amazing to me just how sourness as a flavor profile can screw with one's perception of ABV level in a beer. This one certainly didn't give away it's 10% abv, and I've had other sour beers that were bursting with flavor but only had 3-4% abv. I would gladly drink this often if it was easier to get.

Outstanding beer. My biggest issue with Fuzzy is that the subtle sweetness of the white peaches were drowned out by the intense yogurty sourness.

Just a touch of crisp tartness is present in the scent, but the chardonels really shine through here. The scent displays a little bit of grapey sweetness, but not a whole lot. My overall impression of the smell is that of a slightly tart, off-dry chardonel, that has just a touch of funky dryness at the very end.', 'T- Starts off by assaulting the tongue with fairly aggressive punch of juicy sour flavor. The grape fruit flavors take a back seat to the overall sour flavor, although the tartness is derived out of the fruit. In the middle of the drink, the sourness becomes somewhat acidic and very reminiscent of a War Heads candy. After the peak of the sour flavor, a touch of funkiness creeps in and gives more of a grainy flavor underneath the tartness. Dryness from the barrel is detectable at the end of the drink, although the prominent flavor is still juicy and somewhat fruity tartness.', 'M- This beer is very true to the style and feels pretty much like a champagne. The only difference between a champagne and this beer is the perceived level of thickness because this beer feels fairly thick on the tongue. This is more of a sipper due to the harsh sour flavors in the taste profile.', 'Overall, this was way different than I expected. I was expecting more of a wine-like drinking experience given the name, ingredients, and style. With that being said, this is still a tremendous beer.

The nose has a slightly floral/vanilla grain & barrel sweetness, surprisingly limited tartness, underlying grape notes, and minimal funk/acetone. It has a mild, champagne-like grape taste upfront with grain rounding out profile and lingering alcohol and oak. The beer has a light-medium body, but is not as crushable as expected (mainly due to the alcohol content) and a slightly chewy sweetness. Carbonation is relatively low and acidity is lower than expected - the beer still finishes with that punishing dry oak slap in the palate.

The flavors are really sharply sour, vinous grapes, lemon citrus, green apples, really bitingly sour, funk and oak come out as well, but boy was this sour. The mouthfeel is nice, very carbonated, bubbly, coats the mouth very well, finishes dryly and a bit sharply, but with a light warming sensation from the alcohol.', 'Verdict: A very interesting beer from Side Project. Much like Fuzzy, the nose was immaculate, capturing the perfect essence of chardonnay grapes and white wine, but the flavors are crippled by how sour the beer is and while enjoyable, difficult to handle more than a few ounces.

Enough head topped this off but that didn't translate to the lacing as the bubbles were only seen near the top of my pint glass once I started to work my way through this. Loads of orange, tangerine, vanilla cream, garlic, scallions, and tropical fruits in the nose as the juiciness really burst through in the taste. Slick, smooth, and sweet, there was an underlying hint of spice that livened things up and complemented the initial taste that hit my palate and somehow, it worked! Candied citrus and an underlying dankness rounded things out as this beer didn't stay in my pint glass for very long!"", ""The amount of alcohol in this was spot-on as it was present, but hardly felt, with all of the flavors complementing each other quite nicely to go along with the moderate carbonation.

Yup. It\'s good. Nice sweet fruit on the nose and tongue, and a very creamy mouthfeel. Well balanced as well. Seems more like 6.7% than 8.3%. Little bit of papaya and powdered sugar. Not as good as a few of their beers (Grovestand), but better than most (Dunley Place).

The aroma is incredible and it carries through into the flavor and feel. There's good wine barrel presence, but it's balanced by the Hill mixed culture and the dry hop. There is funkified tropical fruit and some grassiness on the finish. It's amazingly complex, super balanced, with no component overpowering the rest. BA Dorothy is a phenomenally delicate beer."
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/239223/,4.33,"750ml bottle, served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Pours a hazy golden yellow body, one finger thick head, short retention, bits of lacing. Typical HF saison appearance. Smells of grapefruit and citrus, more of a hop aroma, light bitterness and a bit of white wine sweetness and must. Light funk. Bits of oak. Flavour brings out more dry white wine grape, nice mustiness, light farmhouse funk, oak, and light acidity with a more grapefruit zesty bitterness. Very solid. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, light and bitter citrus and saison yeast on the finish. Smells like a Hill Farmstead IPA, but with more of a white wine twist and complexity to it. It's not necessarily one of the better saisons from this brewery, but for what it is, it is very nice."

Pours a gorgeous golden color with a decent head. Nice lacing. The aroma is pure heaven: some maltiness and resin up front, and tropical fruit noticeable. Taste is incredible: a veritable hop explosion, with peaches and those same tropical notes more pronounced. This is a dank brew with a pleasing aftertaste as well. Get it and enjoy, while it lasts."

Whispy clouds of particulate. Sweet malt base with soft grassy, citrus, and floral hops. Some booze. The flavor is sweet, concentrated malt with grass, citrus and lots of booze. The hop character, I think, has faded, but it's still an enjoyable enough beer. While it starts out fairly sweet, the finish is dry with medium, pithy bitterness."

Somewhat weak fruit flavors though. Some resinous sweetness in the middle. Followed by a heavy bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The bitterness is dank and piney and lingers.

Enjoy By gives off an all around pleasant aroma that is wonderfully representative of a west coast style DIPA.', 'Taste: A varied and multilayered hop profile almost attacks the palate with an unrelenting bitterness that drives through to the finish. Aside from that, the hops are hard at work producing different flavors at different stages. Up front, Enjoy By is very herbaceous, then bleeding into light citrus territory, and finally giving off some berry flavors which circulate around the back end. The finish brings the bitter herb driven qualities back with plenty of piney resinous bite with just enough of the honey and graham cracker like malts to round things off. After it warms up good, some green onion, more honey, and some rosemary pop out. The mouthfeel is appropriately thick and chewy without falling into that syrupy sweet malt mess which most +9% DIPAs tend to do. Enjoy By is a really nice beer, shocker there. I do find the pricing a bit high ($17.49 + tax) when I can get beers of equal quality such as Fear Movie Lions or Stone IPA for around $11. I am happy to have tried it regardless."

Medium body has a tautness to it, which I appreciate, but I thought this would be a sweeter, fuller-bodied beer... Had to adjust my expectations as I drank it... I'll have to see if my impression changes with the second half of the bomber, but for my tastes this was really nice - reminds me a bit of a more bitter version of a Southern Tier DIPA I had the past coupla days, Help! On The Way!, which also featured mango..."
Sure Bet,https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/28178/147095/,4.25,"It's funny to me that this is one of Pipeworks' highest rated beers, while their stouts haven't made top 250 - funny how the world spins."", ""Pipeworks distro in MN is still a bit in flux it appears as this bottle popped up in different places over a week or two - thankfully, I was able to grab one before it had too much age on it. This is one of those IPAs that I'm not sure I'd worry too much about age. It's not loaded with sediment and haze, so I think it might weather a bit better. It pours a much cleaner tangerine sort of color with a very nice, clean, sweet nose. The taste is similar, though it does seem to open up a bit as it warms. It has a bit of a ragged edge while too cold. Again, it's awfully sweet - that honey definitely comes through, while the mango provides plenty of tropical fruity sweetness. It's almost cloying in texture and mouthfeel - very rich, very thick."", ""I like Sure Bet - it's a pretty excellent IPA. As sweet as it is, I'm not sure I could stomach more than a glass at a time - so it's more of a novelty to me than anything. Great beer, but certainly not a go-to for me."

I find that the mango puree imparts somewhat of a syrupy texture into the beer that really makes it less enjoyable.\nThis beer has a lasting sweetness that somehow reinforces the alcohol burn in an unpleasant way.

Enjoyed on 8.3.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.', 'The beer pours a copper color, displays chill haze with some orange hues and a foamy white head that has great retention and lace. The aroma is very good, tons of tropical fruits, loads of mango puree, citrus, pineapple, nicely floral with a strong malt backbone, sweet and bready with lightly warm alcohol. The flavors are nice, juicy mango, lots of fruitiness with a lightly piney and resinous counterbalance, moderate bitterness with strong sweet pale grains and warm alcohol. The mouthfeel is good, coating, medium body that is creamy and smooth with a warm and dry finish.', ""Verdict: A very good IPA from Pipeworks. Tons of mango, tons of tropical fruits, really bright and refreshing but more malty and sweet than I'd prefer and the warm alcohol is a consistent issue for me with Pipeworks IPAs. Very good beer but not quite rising to the upper echelons of the style."
